  abstract = {This paper reviews integrated economic and ecological models that address impacts and adaptation to climate change in the forest sector. Early economic model studies considered forests as one out of many possible impacts of climate change, while ecological model studies tended to limit the economic impacts to fixed price-assumptions. More recent studies include broader representations of both systems, but there are still few studies which can be regarded fully integrated. Full integration of ecological and economic models is needed to address forest management under climate change appropriately. The conclusion so far is that there are vast uncertainties about how climate change affects forests. This is partly due to the limited knowledge about the global implications of the social and economical adaptation to the effects of climate change on forests.},

In this context, forest biomass, particularly harvesting residues (branches), and stumps and associated coarse roots, can be used to supply fuelwood chains. However, collecting harvesting residues can affect soil properties and trees, and these effects are still not fully understood. The main objective of the present study was to compile published data worldwide and to quantify the overall effects of removing harvesting residues on nutrient outputs, chemical and biological soil fertility and tree growth, through a meta-analysis. Our study showed that, compared with conventional stem-only harvest, removing the stem plus the harvesting residues generally increases nutrient outputs thereby leading to reduced amounts of total and available nutrients in soils and soil acidification, particularly when foliage is harvested along with the branches. Losses of available nutrients in soils could also be explained by reduced microbial activity and mineralization fluxes, which in turn, may be affected by changes in organic matter quality and environmental conditions (soil compaction, temperature and moisture). Soil fertility losses were shown to have consequences for the subsequent forest ecosystem: tree growth was reduced by 3–7% in the short or medium term (up to 33 years after harvest) in the most intensive harvests (e.g. when branches are exported with foliage). Combining all the results showed that, overall, whole-tree harvesting has negative impacts on soil properties and trees that may have an impact on the functioning of forest ecosystems. Practical measures that could be taken to mitigate the environmental consequences of removing harvesting residues are discussed.},

But how does this variation affect the outcome of interspecific competition and hence community structure? We derive criteria for the outcome of competition among tree species competing for light, given their allometric and life-history parameters. These criteria are defined in terms of a new simple whole life-cycle measure of performance, which provides a simple way to organize and understand the many ways in which species differ. The general case, in which all parameters can differ between species, can produce coexistence, founder control or competitive exclusion: thus, competition for light need not be hierarchical as implied by R* theory. The special case in which species differ only in crown transmissivity produces neutral dynamics. The special case in which species differ in all parameters except crown transmissivity gives hierarchical competition, where the equivalent of R* is , the height at which trees enter the canopy in an equilibrium monoculture.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is on the one hand to identify the most determining variables predicting the site productivity of pedunculate oak, common beech and Scots pine in temperate lowland forests of Flanders; and on the other hand to test whether the accuracy of site productivity models based exclusively on soil or forest floor predictor variables is similar to the accuracy achieved by full ecosystem models, combining all soil, vegetation, humus and litterfall composition related variables. Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) were used to model in a climatically homogeneous region the relationship between environmental variables and site productivity. A distinction was made between soil (soil physical and chemical), forest floor (vegetation and humus) and ecosystem (soil, forest floor and litterfall composition jointly) predictors. Our results have illustrated the strength of BRT to model the non-linear behaviour of ecological processes. The ecosystem models, based on all collected variables, explained most of the variability and were more accurate than those limited to either soil or forest floor variables. Nevertheless, both the soil and forest floor models can serve as good predictive models for many forest management practices. Soil granulometric fractions and litterfall nitrogen concentrations were the most effective predictors of forest site productivity in Flanders. Although many studies revealed a fertilising effect of increased nitrogen deposition, nitrogen saturation seemed to reduce species' productivity in this region.},

  abstract = {Forestry science has a long tradition of studying the relationship between stand productivity and abiotic and biotic site characteristics, such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation. Many of the early site quality modelling studies related site index to environmental variables using basic statistical methods such as linear regression. Because most ecological variables show a typical non-linear course and a non-constant variance distribution, a large fraction of the variation remained unexplained by these linear models. More recently, the development of more advanced non-parametric and machine learning methods provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, these methods also have drawbacks. Due to their increasing complexity they are not only more difficult to implement and interpret, but also more vulnerable to overfitting. Especially in a context of regionalisation, this may prove to be problematic. Although many non-parametric and machine learning methods are increasingly used in applications related to forest site quality assessment, their predictive performance has only been assessed for a limited number of methods and ecosystems. In this study, five different modelling techniques are compared and evaluated, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), generalized additive models (GAM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Each method is used to model site index of homogeneous stands of three important tree species of the Taurus Mountains (Turkey): Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra and Cedrus libani. Site index is related to soil, vegetation and topographical variables, which are available for 167 sample plots covering all important environmental gradients in the research area. The five techniques are compared in a multi-criteria decision analysis in which different model performance measures, ecological interpretability and user-friendliness are considered as criteria. When combining these criteria, in most cases GAM is found to outperform all other techniques for modelling site index for the three species. BRT is a good alternative in case the ecological interpretability of the technique is of higher importance. When user-friendliness is more important MLR and CART are the preferred alternatives. Despite its good predictive performance, ANN is penalized for its complex, non-transparent models and big training effort.},

Site productivity maps, commonly representing the site index (SI) of a specific tree species, allow foresters to forecast wood production over the entire area of interest and hence select the most appropriate location for establishing a particular tree species mix. In many situations, forest SI cannot be directly measured from the dominant height and age of a stand and must therefore be directly estimated from relevant local site factors related to climate, topography and/or soil (attribute-based approach). Alternatively, estimations can also be made based on site information available for nearby locations (location-based approach). Also both approaches can be combined (hybrid approach). Since there is no straightforward procedure for selecting the most appropriate approach, the performance of five regionalization techniques was compared for predictive mapping of the SI of two important tree species in the temperate lowland region of Flanders (Belgium): one location-based technique (ordinary kriging), one attribute-based technique (regression) and three hybrid techniques (geomatching, ordinary co-kriging and regression kriging). From the findings of this case study, it cannot be concluded that one technique outperforms the others under all circumstances, but it was possible to build a decision tree providing guidance in selecting an appropriate SI mapping technique depending on the availability and characteristics of the data.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary responses are required for tree populations to be able to track climate change. Results of 250 years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reflecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation-related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90% and 78% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand specific issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration. Despite the long generation times, the strong background in quantitative genetics and growing genomic resources make forest trees useful species for climate change research. The greatest adaptive response is expected when populations are large, have high genetic variability, selection is strong, and there is ecological opportunity for establishment of better adapted genotypes.},

These shifts are expected to be most rapid and extreme at ecotones, the boundaries between ecosystems, particularly those in semiarid landscapes. However, current models do not adequately provide for such rapid effects—particularly those caused by mortality—largely because of the lack of data from field studies. Here we report the most rapid landscape-scale shift of a woody ecotone ever documented: in northern New Mexico in the 1950s, the ecotone between semiarid ponderosa pine forest and piñon–juniper woodland shifted extensively (2 km or more) and rapidly (<5 years) through mortality of ponderosa pines in response to a severe drought. This shift has persisted for 40 years. Forest patches within the shift zone became much more fragmented, and soil erosion greatly accelerated. The rapidity and the complex dynamics of the persistent shift point to the need to represent more accurately these dynamics, especially the mortality factor, in assessments of the effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This study reports cubic-foot volume yields for particular product definitions from a 25-year-old loblolly pine spacing trial and shows how closely, in the absence of thinning, total and merchantable wood production are linked to initial spacing. Results at the close of the study indicate that (1) high-density plantations can be managed on short rotations for woody biomass production; (2) pulpwood yields can be maximized at a planting density in the neighborhood of 680 trees/ac; (3) the production of solidwood products, without imposing thinning, requires lower establishment densities, with as few as 300 trees/ac planted resulting in a substantial proportion of the total yield recovered as large sawtimber; and (4) a ratio of between-row to within-row planting distances of at least 3:1 does not substantially affect yield production. Considered together, the results of this study suggest that no single planting density is optimal for the wide array of product objectives for which loblolly pine is managed in the South. Rather, managers must select an appropriate planting density in view of the products anticipated at harvest.},

  abstract = {Tree populations located at the geographical distribution limit of the species may provide valuable information about tree-growth response to changes on climatic conditions. We established nine Pinus nigra, 12 P. sylvestris and 17 P. uncinata tree-ring width chronologies along the eastern and northern Iberian Peninsula, where these species are found at the edge of their natural range. Tree-growth variability was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) for the period 1885-1992. Despite the diversity of species, habitats and climatic regimes, a common macroclimatic signal expressed by the first principal component (PC1) was found. Moreover, considering the PC1 scores as a regional chronology, significant relations were established with Spanish meteorological data. The shared variance held by the tree chronologies, the frequency of narrow rings and the interannual growth variability (sensitivity) increased markedly during the studied period. This shows an enhancement of growth synchrony among forests indicating that climate might have become more limiting to growth. Noticeably, an upward abrupt shift in common variability at the end of the first half of the 20th century was detected. On the other hand, moving-interval response functions showed a change in the growth-climate relationships during the same period. The relationship between growth and late summer/autumn temperatures of the year before growth (August-September, negative correlation, and November, positive correlation) became stronger. Hence, water stress increase during late summer previous to tree growth could be linked to the larger growth synchrony among sites, suggesting that climate was driving the growth pattern changes. This agrees with the upward trend in temperature observed in these months. Moreover, the higher occurrence of extreme years and the sensitivity increase in the second half of the 20th century were in agreement with an increment in precipitation variability during the growing period. Precipitation variability was positively related to tree-growth variability, but negatively to radial growth. In conclusion, a change in tree-growth pattern and in the climatic response of the studied forests was detected since the mid-20th century and linked to an increase in water stress. These temporal trends were in agreement with the observed increase in warmer conditions and in precipitation variability.},

  abstract = {We investigated the tree growth and physiological response of five pine forest stands in relation to changes in atmospheric CO(2) concentration (c(a)) and climate in the Iberian Peninsula using annually resolved width and delta 13C tree-ring chronologies since ad 1600. 13C discrimination (delta approximate to c(i)/c(a)), leaf intercellular CO(2) concentration (c(i)) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) were inferred from delta 13C values. The most pronounced changes were observed during the second half of the 20th century, and differed between stands. Three sites kept a constant c(i)/c(a) ratio, leading to significant c(i) and iWUE increases (active response to c(a)); whereas a significant increase in c(i)/c(a) resulted in the lowest iWUE increase of all stands at a relict Pinus uncinata forest site (passive response to c(a)). A significant decrease in c(i)/c(a) led to the greatest iWUE improvement at the northwestern site. We tested the climatic signal strength registered in the delta 13C series after removing the low-frequency trends due to the physiological responses to increasing c(a). We found stronger correlations with temperature during the growing season, demonstrating that the physiological response to c(a) changes modulated delta 13C and masked the climate signal. Since 1970 higher delta 13C values revealed iWUE improvements at all the sites exceeding values expected by an active response to the c(a) increase alone. These patterns were related to upward trends in temperatures, indicating that other factors are reinforcing stomatal closure in these forests. Narrower rings during the second half of the 20th century than in previous centuries were observed at four sites and after 1970 at all sites, providing no evidence for a possible CO(2) 'fertilization' effect on growth. The iWUE improvements found for all the forests, reflecting both a c(a) rise and warmer conditions, seem to be insufficient to compensate for the negative effects of the increasing water limitation on growth.},

  abstract =  {<p>Climate change is increasing the risk of drought to forested ecosystems. Although drought impacts are often anecdotally noted to occur in discrete patches of high canopy mortality, the landscape effects of drought disturbances have received virtually no study. This study characterized the landscape configuration of drought impact patches and investigated the relationships between patch characteristics, as indicators of drought impact intensity, and environmental gradients related to water availability to determine factors influencing drought vulnerability. Drought impact patches were delineated from aerial surveys following an extreme drought in 2011 in southwestern Australia, which led to patchy canopy dieback of the Northern Jarrah Forest, a Mediterranean forest ecosystem. On average, forest gaps produced by drought-induced dieback were moderate in size (6.6 � 9.7 ha, max = 85.7 ha), compact in shape, and relatively isolated from each other at the scale of several kilometers. However, there was considerable spatial variation in the size, shape, and clustering of forest gaps. Drought impact patches were larger and more densely clustered in xeric areas, with significant relationships observed with topographic wetness index, meteorological variables, and stand height. Drought impact patch clustering was more strongly associated with the environmental factors assessed (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.32) than was patch size (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.21); variation in patch shape remained largely unexplained (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.02). There is evidence that the xeric areas with more intense drought impacts are ?chronic disturbance patches? susceptible to recurrent drought disturbance. The spatial configuration of drought disturbances is likely to influence ecological processes including forest recovery and interacting disturbances such as fire. Regime shifts to an alternate, non-forested ecosystem may occur preferentially in areas with large or clustered drought impact patches. Improved understanding of drought impacts and their patterning in space and time will expand our knowledge of forest ecosystems and landscape processes, informing management of these dynamic systems in an uncertain future.</p>},

In applying the site index concept, one typically assumes that height development is not affected by stand density or thinning treatment. This assumption has been challenged by recent studies on loblolly pine. A detailed data set with initial densities ranging from 6,730 to 750 trees/ha and covering ages 1 through 25 after plantation establishment was used to study and model the effect of initial spacing on height development of loblolly pine. Dominant height was found to be dependent on initial spacing. Height-age models are proposed that take into account the effect of spacing on average and dominant height. The differences among plantation densities are evident from age 6 and are consistent to the end of the 25-year period of study. Previous studies in other conifers have reported an early advantage in terms of height growth in denser stands that tend to disappear with age, producing a crossover of the growth trajectories. No evidence of this crossover effect in height was found.},

Subsequent fires have resulted in patchy regeneration where suitable gaps in the overstorey were present. In 1949 three main types of the understorey were present: type A, mature <i>Pomaderris aspera</i>; type B, dense immature <i>Pomaderris aspera</i>; and type C, coppiced <i>Olearia argophylla</i> and <i>Bedfordia arborescens</i>. In type A, ground fern was patchy and statistically correlated with patches of lower density <i>Pomaderris aspera</i>. Over a period of 48 years the eucalypt overstorey has been depleted by death and windthrow while understorey trees and shrubs have been severely damaged by sporadic heavy snowfalls and insect and fungal attack. The type A understorey is now showing signs of changing to <i>Olearia argophylla</i> dominance and the cover of ground fern and tree fern strata has doubled to more than 80% over this period in spite of damage caused by infrequent, but severe, droughts. The type B understorey is now mature and resembles type A, while the type C understorey shows invasion by <i>Pomaderris aspera</i> and regeneration of <i>Olearia argophylla</i>. No successful establishment of <i>E. regnans</i> has occurred. The rainforest in the gullies consists of alternating patches of forest and tree fern groves, the latter, together with rotting logs and upthrown root balls, providing niches for rainforest tree establishment. In swampy flats of <i>Leptospermum grandifolium</i> on the plateau <i>Atherosperma moschatum</i> is becoming increasingly dominant. <i>Atherosperma moschatum</i> is also invading mature understorey adjacent to riparian communities. This species and <i>Olearia argophylla</i> may constitute the final stage of the long secondary succession after fire in the Big Ash area. However, the Hume Range is adjacent to drier foothills and plains to the north, west and south. Whether the Big Ash will be spared from fire in future centuries is very doubtful.},

  abstract = {At a local scale, forest trees and stands have a marked influence on climate; thus it is possible to define microclimates. These effects depend on local climatic characteristics and stand type. All climatic parameters should be considered, but particular attention should be paid to temperature, light and water. From a silvicultural point of view knowledge of the interactions existing between microclimatic conditions and stands, in conjunction with information now available concerning tree ecophysiology make it possible to produce viable applications which are useful for silviculture during stand formation, and for applying silvicultural treatments. Whitout a doubt, Laking forest cover interactions into account (climate and ecophysiological potential of species) is the basis of sustainable management in forests. Based on the current knowledge about young stands, it is possible to use existing vegetation cover, in a more or less modified form, to improve temperature conditions especially in relation to spring frost damage, and to improve water conditions for both plant uptake and plant growth for a variable period depending on the species, but for a minimum of 4 to 5 years. For clearing and thinning, the effects of microclimatic changes created by this type of forestry management, and consequently the response of trees in terms of photosynthesis and growth, are now well defined.},

However, the relations between light transmittance through the canopy and the dendrometric characteristics of the population are an important aid in defining different development strategies. This article discusses light transmittance by the canopy (1) in uniform (regular or even-aged) forests, where the distribution of light on the ground below the canopy is easily determined from the dendrometric characteristics of the population, and (2) in irregular (uneven-aged) and/or mixed forests, where the spatial variability of light transmittance is greatly increased. Ways of predicting light transmittance in both situations are described. Practical models (including a marteloscope) are presented for simulating the distribution of light under the canopy of a heterogeneous forest, with future projections under various thinning and growth scenarios.},

Field data for a mixed oak [Quercus petraea and Q. robur] stand in France enabled the unknown parameters of the model to be determined with the help of an identification technique. The model was then used to analyse the experimental results presented in part I of this paper. The loss of total conductivity of the soil-tree system under drought conditions whereas the metabolism of the trees seems to remain unaffected, can be explained by the increase of the soil-root resistance. This resistance becomes the limiting factor when the volumetric soil water content decreases (below theta = 0.33 for the superficial layer and 0.36 for the deeper one in the studied case). Such values can be frequently encountered at the end of the summer.},

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that broad-leaved forest species with contrasting wood anatomy and hydraulic system (ring-porous versus diffuse-porous) also differ in distribution and seasonal dynamics of carbohydrate reserves in stem wood. Total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves (starch and sugars) were measured enzymatically in the 10 youngest stem xylem rings of adult oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees during an annual cycle. Radial distribution of carbohydrates was investigated according to ring age. On all dates, oak trees had twofold higher TNC concentration than beech trees (41 versus 23 mg gDM−1), with starch accounting for the high TNC concentration in oak. Seasonal dynamics of TNC concentration were significantly (P < 0.05) more pronounced in oak (20–64 mg TNC gDM−1) than in beech (17–34 mg TNC gDM−1). A marked decrease in TNC concentration was observed in oak trees during bud burst and early wood growth, whereas seasonal fluctuations in TNC concentrations in beech trees were small. The radial distribution of TNC based on ring age differed between species: TNC was restricted to the sapwood rings in oak, whereas in beech, it was distributed throughout the wood from the outermost sapwood ring to the pith. Although the high TNC concentrations in the outermost rings accounted for most of the observed seasonal pattern, all of the 10 youngest xylem rings analyzed participated in the seasonal dynamics of TNC in beech trees. The innermost sapwood rings of oak trees had low TNC concentrations. Stem growth and accumulation of carbon reserves occurred concomitantly during the first part of the season, when there was no soil water deficit. When soil water content was depleted, stem growth ceased in both species, whereas TNC accumulation was negligibly affected and continued until leaf fall. The contrasting dynamics and distribution of carbohydrate reserves in oak and beech are discussed with reference to differences in phenology, early spring growth and hydraulic properties between ring-porous trees and diffuse-porous trees.},

  abstract = {1. The relationship between soil resource availability and competitive interactions remains unclear in forest ecosystems. If competition shifts from below-ground to above-ground across soil resource gradients, then competitive interactions should constrain growth across soil fertility levels. Alternatively, competition may be less important under stressful conditions associated with low soil resources. 2. We developed individual-based growth models as functions of local tree neighbourhood and measurements of soil resources for 10 common tree species from sites established across a soil resource gradient in north-west Lower Michigan, USA. We hypothesized that tree growth should increase with soil resource availability (rarely measured at local scales), but decrease with the density, size and proximity of neighbouring trees. 3. Correlations of growth to neighbourhood effects were strongest for species occupying primarily high-resource sites. Correlations of growth to soil resources were positive for species associated with high and intermediate fertility. In contrast, correlations of growth to soil water were negative for species associated with low fertility, suggesting that competitiveness of these species decreased with higher soil resources and concomitant decreases in irradiance. 4. Relationships between mean site-level tree growth and soil resources were much stronger than individual growth-local resource relationships. Weaker species-specific, individual-level trends likely arose from limited species distributions across each soil resource domain. 5. Synthesis. Neighbourhood interactions were more prevalent in species associated with high soil fertility sites, where canopy transmission of irradiance was low. For species dominant at low fertility, where canopy transmission of irradiance was relatively high, neighbourhood interactions were absent or negligible. The growth of intermediate-fertility species was negatively correlated with soil water, but decreasing site-level canopy openness with soil water suggests that these species were out-competed for irradiance as soil resources increased. Thus, irradiance likely mediated the stronger competitive interactions at higher-fertility sites.},

Zero inflated data are defined as data that has a larger proportion of zeros than expected from pure count (Poisson) data. The standard methodology is to model the data in two steps, first modelling the association between the presence and absence of a species and the available covariates and second, modelling the relationship between abundance and the covariates, conditional on the organism being present. The approach in this paper extends previous work to incorporate the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) in the modelling steps.

  abstract = {A dendroecological study was carried out in 2 forests in northeastern France with the aim of identifying and quantifying possible long-term trends in the radial growth of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt) Liebl) and pedunculate oak (Q robur L). A total of 150 sites were selected to represent the ecological diversity of these forests. An index Cd was used to correct annual ring width in order to compensate for the effect of different competition situations. The data were standardized with reference to the mean curve 'basal area increment vs cambial age'. The growth index curves revealed a strong increase in sessile oak growth (+ 64% during the period 1888 to 1987) as well as in that of peduncutate oak (+40%). The growth increase in the 'young' rings (<60 years) of sessile oak was + 87 %, and that of young rings of pedunculate oak was + 49%. The corresponding increase in the 'old' rings (>65 years) was + 48% and 15% respectively (not significant for the latter). It would thus appear that pedunculate oak has benefited to a lesser extent than sessile oak from the progressive changes in its environment. Years showing a strong growth decrease are more common for pedunculate oak than for sessile oak. These results are consistent with a recent hypothesis about a slow but general retreat of pedunculate oak, including severe episodic declines, in favour of sessile oak in many regions of France. A model was created using a combination of meteorological data (monthly precipitation and temperature) starting in 1881, and increasing atmospheric CO, concentrations. The model explains 78.3% of the variance for sessile oak and 74.3% for pedunculate oak. This includes some monthly parameters of year y (year of ring formation), and also some parameters of the years y-1 to y-4 for sessile oak and y-1 to y-5 for pedunculate oak. The models satisfactorily reproduce the long-term trends and the interannual variation. The climatic variables alone (ie excluding the CO, concentration) were insufficient to explain the trends observed. The possible direct and indirect effects of increasing CO2 concentration on the growth of both species are discussed.},

  abstract = {Question: Predictive models constitute an important tool in multiple ecological applications. In this paper, we examine and compare the performance of six state-of-the-art methods commonly used in ecological modelling: Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Location: Northern Spain. Methods: We used presence/absence data of 15 plant species of an alpine rangeland in northern Spain and 14 topographical and geomorphological descriptors to build the models. We used leave-one-out cross validation on each model and computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the resolution and calibration diagrams of the resulting probabilistic predictions. We also analysed the binary presence/absence deterministic predictions and computed the corresponding confusion matrices to calculate sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and the True Skill Statistic (TSS). Results: In general, CART and MAXENT showed poor performance and MLR was competitive with the more sophisticated ANN, MARS and SVM methods. The best predictive resolution was obtained, in most cases, by ANN followed by SVM and CART models; however, MLR and MARS were generally the best calibrated. The MAXENT predictions attained, in general, poor resolution and moderate to good calibration. Conclusion: Assessment of model calibration and resolution, in addition to ROC and confusion matrix-derived indices, is an important step for model choice depending on the final aim. Most of the target species were accurately predicted showing that the variables used are suitable descriptors at the scale of analysis.},

  abstract = {1. A prominent idea in the literature on plant-herbivore interactions is that fast-growing species have low resistance but high resilience to herbivory. In other words, fast-growing species are selectively eaten by herbivores but recover quickly following damage. Many studies have challenged the generality of this theory, but little attention has been paid to plant species that have evolved in the absence of major groups of herbivores. Here we analyse whether this resistance-resilience trade-off applies to New Zealand woody species, which evolved without exposure to mammalian herbivores until their introduction in 19th century. 2. We simulated deer browse by clipping saplings of 12 tree species to varying extents (0, 20, 40, 80 and 100% of leaf-bearing branches removed), and quantified the shoot growth, diameter growth and survival of these saplings. The time taken to regrow the removed branches was generally slow, but varied among species. For example, species took between 0.5 and 3 years to recover from removal of 60% of branches. It was the inherently fast-growing species that recovered most quickly. Some species had stimulated shoot growth at moderate levels of clipping (40-60%) but this effect had relatively little effect on recovery time compared with differences in potential growth rates of species. 3. Diameter growth rate fell linearly with increased clipping intensity for all 12 species, and there was no indication of recovery 2 years after the treatment. We speculate that saplings invested in rebuilding their canopies following clipping, and that few resources were left over for diameter growth. 4. Few saplings died as a result of clipping, except when 100% of leaf-bearing shoots were removed, in which case five species died in substantial numbers (> 15%), including all three conifers in the study. 5. Previous work has shown that the most palatable species (i.e. those with low resistance) have leaves with low fibre content. We find that these species are relatively fast growing and recover most rapidly from simulated browsing (i.e. are highly resilient). This provides some support for a resistance-resilience trade-off related to potential growth rates. 6. Deer invasion in New Zealand was associated with the loss of short soft-leaved tree species from the browse layer. Our study suggests that the most palatable species have the potential to grow fast and may be in a relatively strong position to recover if deer are eradicated.},

  abstract = {1. Timber harvesting exemplifies many aspects of experimental manipulation in applied ecology. Evaluation of the research approaches used to assess ecological effects of harvesting thus has relevance to a diverse range of ecological questions that address large-scale and human impacts on the environment. 2. We measured the frequency of approaches, and also design and statistical issues, in assessments of harvesting effects on three response variables (tree regeneration, vertebrates and water) in two major native forests of south-east Australia. Our evaluation was based on 124 documents that contain unique, field-based research and that represent the complete written record (published and unpublished) of relevant research prior to mid-2002. 3. The dominant approach was contrasts between manipulated stands, nearly always involving mature and old-growth stands as the reference or control. In studies of tree regeneration, focus on wood-production objectives was apparent in the relatively frequent use of stocking standards, and in the use of between- and within-stand contrasts without a control condition. Comparatively greater use of models in vertebrate and water studies suggested more frequent integration of generic principles and, in water studies, reflected strong collective knowledge based on the repeated use of BACI-type designs (i.e. before-after, control-impact) or long-term data sets. 4. Statistical issues such as poor reporting of experimental designs and of sample statistics were common. Explicit hypotheses were rare, and there was no evidence of definition of critical effect sizes, use of power analysis or use of non-classical statistical approaches (e.g. Bayesian inference). 5. Lack of treatment replication was widespread in between-stand contrasts and less frequent in within-stand contrasts. Inappropriate interpretation of results from non-replicated experimental designs remains an ongoing issue. 6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of information obtainable from stand-level manipulations of forest would substantially increase through greater attention to data quality and experimental protocols. Studies require broader experimental contexts, including their potential place in meta-replication frameworks. Increasingly, constraints of large-scale manipulations necessitate the integration of data and the acknowledgement of uncertainty in formalized systems (e.g. Bayesian methods and adaptive management frameworks). Our evaluation suggests the alternative is a perpetuation of short-term, isolated studies that repeat errors and have limited potential to refine knowledge on the ecological effects of timber harvesting and other similarly scaled disturbances.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fires are a common management practice in the temperate forests of Australia, but effects on total forest carbon (C) of long-term prescribed fire regimes, involving multiple repeat fires, remain under-examined. This study quantified C stocks in multiple pools after 27 years of a long-term prescribed fire experiment in a mixed-species eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia. The experimental design included five replications of each of five treatments – a long-unburnt Control, plus a factorial combination of two fire frequencies (c. 3-yearly ‘High’, c. 10-yearly ‘Low’), and two fire seasons (Spring, Autumn) – encompassing up to 7 low-intensity repeat fires over the 27 years. Overall, total C stocks (the sum of all pools: Above-ground biomass, Dead wood, Litter, and Soil) were significantly greater in Control than Fire treatments. Mean total C stock differences (Control minus Fire) were 36 Mg ha−1, and increased with both fire frequency (46 Mg ha−1, Control versus High frequency treatments) and fires in autumn rather than spring (42 Mg ha−1, Control versus Autumn treatments). Mean differences had wide 95% confidence intervals (e.g. 4–67 Mg C ha−1, Control versus Fire), indicating considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of effects of prescribed fire regimes on total C in these native forests. Weighted averaging of linear multiple regression models was used to identify the most important variables for explaining proportional C stock differences ((Control–Fire)/Control), and involved consideration of 85 explanatory variables including measures of fire intensity, fire severity, fuel, pre- and post-fire rainfall, fire weather, and topography. The best regression model explained 80% of variation in total C stock differences between Control and Fire treatments. Consistently important explanatory variables were those representing or associated with fire intensity (flame angle, wind speed, Forest Fire Danger Index), and number of prescribed fires. Measures of fuel load, pre- and post-fire rainfall, and, in particular, fire severity, were less important explanatory variables. The study provides indications of management options for minimising C stock decreases associated with prescribed fire regimes in temperate eucalypt forests; notably, wide fire intervals (closer to 10 than 3 years), and utilising strategies to minimise mean fire intensity, including burning in moist (spring) rather than dry (autumn) conditions.},

Site- and region-specific studies suggest that large trees, which play keystone roles in forests6and can be disproportionately important to ecosystem carbon storage7and hydrology8, exhibit greater sensitivity to drought than small trees4,5,9,10. Here, we synthesize data on tree growth and mortality collected during 40 drought events in forests worldwide to see whether this size-dependent sensitivity to drought holds more widely. We find that droughts consistently had a more detrimental impact on the growth and mortality rates of larger trees. Moreover, drought-related mortality increased with tree size in 65% of the droughts examined, especially when community-wide mortality was high or when bark beetles were present. The more pronounced drought sensitivity of larger trees could be underpinned by greater inherent vulnerability to hydraulic stress11–14, the higher radiation and evaporative demand experienced by exposed crowns4,15, and the tendency for bark beetles to preferentially attack larger trees16. We suggest that future droughts will have a more detrimental impact on the growth and mortality of larger trees, potentially exacerbating feedbacks to climate change.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of drought events over the next few decades in Western Europe. Consequently, there is a crucial need for an efficient tool for field water budget diagnosis to enable forest managers to estimate tree survival and productivity. Robust estimates of water budget using soil and topography were compared for their ability to predict site yield of Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. Site yield was estimated using site index at 100 years. Ninety-nine even-aged high-forest stands located in northern France were investigated. Water budget was estimated by topographic position and soil water capacity (SWC) calculated for different soil depths down to a maximum 2.0 m. (1) Site index predictions improved when calculating SWC for increasing depths until 1.0 m. (2) Site index predictions did not improve when calculating SWC at depths below 1.0 m, thus confirming that the water contained in deep soil layers is not used for tree growth but probably contributes to tree fitness or survival by maintaining a not too negative in-tree water potential. (3) Topographic position was also a predictor of site index in addition to SWC. Practical recommendations for estimating extractable soil water content are given.},

Two models were applied to two samples, sample A and sample B (sample B being a sub-sample with limited cambial age and calendar date ranges). Model 1 showed a significant increase in radial growth: +35%, +87% and +66% in earlywood width, latewood width and ring width, respectively, from 1811 to 1993 for sample A. Consequently, there was a positive trend in late wood ratio (+14%). A slight decrease in wood density was found: -3.3% and -5.4% for earlywood and late-wood density, respectively. Despite an increase in late wood percentage, mean ring density showed a -2.0% decrease. Model 1 applied to a biomass indicator (densityxring width) showed a 62% increase from 10.4 to 16.8 kg m(-3) between 1811 and 1993 for sample A. Results for sample B were slightly different: the increase in latewood ratio was not detected. Model 2 showed a change with time in the positive hyperbolic relationship between mean density and ring width. The results are discussed. The decrease in wood density cannot be explained by N atmospheric deposition or by long-term changes in average temperature. Increasing atmospheric CO(2) levels cannot be invoked owing to the present lack of studies. Finally, hypotheses concerning long-term changes in wood anatomical characteristics are proposed.},

  abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.) wood density is related to ring width, but most have focused on within-tree variability and have never explored large ecological gradients. Other studies indicate that ring width is largely controlled by ecological factors. Hence it has been concluded that ecological factors have an effect on wood density, yet few studies have directly analysed the link between these two variables. The respective effects of climate, soil water capacity and nutrient richness on wood density are also debated. Lastly, sessile oak is a ring-porous species, so that earlywood and latewood are likely to be differently influenced by ecological factors. Our objectives were (1) to test whether wood density remains under the influence of ecological factors after statistically controlling for ring width, (2) to compare the direction and magnitude of site factors on ring width and mean ring density and (3) to compare the response of earlywood and latewood. A total of 18,287 rings were analysed from 297 dominant sessile oaks in 99 plots distributed over north-eastern and north-western France in mature, even-aged high-forest stands. Wood density and width were measured using X-ray microdensitometry. Multiple regressions were performed on plot means using ecological factors as predictors, and then using ring width or latewood proportion as covariable. Regressions were followed by variance partitioning. The ecological factors had an effect on mean ring density that was independent of ring width, but their effect was slight. The percentage of variance explained by ecological factors was twice as high for radial growth components (earlywood, latewood and total ring width) as for wood density components (earlywood, latewood and mean ring density). Climatic, water-related and nutrient-related factors did not always have a consistent effect on radial growth and wood density. Earlywood and latewood responded slightly differently to the ecological factors, with a higher sensitivity of latewood to climate/water-related factors. Unexpectedly, mean ring density did not correlate with ring width at plot scale, although mean ring density and ring width were nearly always positively correlated within a tree. No correlation between ring width and ring mean density at plot scale may be due to the opposite effects of water-related factors on latewood proportion and latewood density. Our results help identify best site conditions for high-quality sessile oak production and argue for a revision of the French management policy. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide(1,2), leading to novel species assemblages(3,4). Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals(5). Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas(6). We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 degrees C of the effective increase of 1.07 degrees C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 degrees C of the 1.11 degrees C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms(7), the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes(8,9), and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition(10).},

  abstract = {Species distribution modelling is an easy, persuasive and useful tool for anticipating species distribution shifts under global change. Numerous studies have used only climate variables to predict future potential species range shifts and have omitted environmental factors important for determining species distribution. Here, we assessed the importance of the edaphic dimension in the niche-space definition of Quercus pubescens and in future spatial projections under global change over the metropolitan French forest territory. We fitted two species distribution models (SDM) based on presence/absence data (111 similar to 013 plots), one calibrated from climate variables only (mean temperature of January and climatic water balance of July) and the other one from both climate and edaphic (soil pH inferred from plants) variables. Future predictions were conducted under two climate scenarios (PCM B2 and HadCM3 A2) and based on 100 simulations using a cellular automaton that accounted for seed dispersal distance, landscape barriers preventing migration and unsuitable land cover. Adding the edaphic dimension to the climate-only SDM substantially improved the niche-space definition of Q. pubescens, highlighting an increase in species tolerance in confronting climate constraints as the soil pH increased. Future predictions over the 21st century showed that disregarding the edaphic dimension in SDM led to an overestimation of the potential distribution area, an underestimation of the spatial fragmentation of this area, and prevented the identification of local refugia, leading to an underestimation of the northward shift capacity of Q. pubescens and its persistence in its current distribution area. Spatial discrepancies between climate-only and climate-plus-edaphic models are strengthened when seed dispersal and forest fragmentation are accounted for in predicting a future species distribution area. These discrepancies highlight some imprecision in spatial predictions of potential distribution area of species under climate change scenarios and possibly wrong conclusions for conservation and management perspectives when climate-only models are used.},

Validation statistics obtained through a resampling approach showed little local bias over any range of relative height and the 95% confidence limits of prediction error were mostly within 10% over the entire range of relative height for all species.

On log scales, this equation becomes a self-thinning surface that defines a density-dependent upper frontier of stand biomass over a gradient of site productivity for a given species. This equation is formulated for parameter estimation as a stochastic frontier function with two error components that have different distributional properties. As an example, maximum likelihood estimates of the self-thinning surface and its confidence envelope were shown for <i>Pinus radiata</i> (D. Don). Furthermore, site occupancy was estimated through one of the error components of the stochastic frontier function. The conditional response of mortality at any given site occupancy was revealed by using regression quantiles. Light mortality was associated with increases in site occupancy, while heavy mortality caused a reduction in site occupancy. Changes in the estimated site occupancy had a linear relationship with changes in log stand density. The dynamic interplay between site occupancy and mortality, together with the random external effects on the self-thinning frontier, was suggested to drive the growth trajectories of individual stands during stand growth and self-thinning. Consequently, individual stands seldom travel along their self-thinning frontiers but are more likely to converge toward them during the self-thinning phase of stand development. FOR.

We give a precise characterization of the effect of this hierarchy constraint, prove that hierarchy holds with probability one and derive an unbiased estimate for the degrees of freedom of our estimator. A bound on this estimate reveals the amount of fitting "saved" by the hierarchy constraint. We distinguish between parameter sparsity-the number of nonzero coefficients-and practical sparsity-the number of raw variables one must measure to make a new prediction. Hierarchy focuses on the latter, which is more closely tied to important data collection concerns such as cost, time and effort. We develop an algorithm, available in the R package hierNet, and perform an empirical study of our method.},

Rather than resulting from flawed or fraudulent science, we suggest that conflicting findings may often result front the complex nature of environmental systems and the limitations of our analytical tools. Using heuristic simulation examples, we shou, how environmental heterogeneity and limitations in our ability to measure and model environmental systems can give rise to conflicting inferences even for very simple systems. Although analytical tools are improving, individual studies will remain limited in their ability to describe complex environmental systems. We suggest that, instead of being a curse, multiple studies with conflicting findings often provide an opportunity to expand and refine our understanding of complex environmental systems. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we show how pooling multiple studies can enable us to generate a broader, richer, and more accurate understanding of the dynamics of a system and to better estimate our uncertainties.},

In this study, we evaluated drought as a possible inciting factor of Scots pine decline in the Valais. Averaged tree-ring widths, standardized tree-ring series, and estimated annual mortality risks were related to a drought index. Correlations between drought indices and standardized tree-ring series from 11 sites showed a moderate association. Several drought years and drought periods could be detected since 1864 that coincided with decreased growth. Although single, extreme drought years had generally a short-term, reversible effect on tree growth, multi-year drought initiated prolonged growth decreases that increased a tree's long-term risk of death. Tree death occurred generally several years or even decades after the drought. In conclusion, drought has a limiting effect on tree growth and acts as a bottleneck event in triggering Scots pine decline in the Valais.},

The objectives of this study were to (i) determine growth patterns (growth levels and growth trends) over different time windows that can be used to discriminate between dead and living Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees, (ii) optimize the selection of growth variables in logistic mortality models, and (iii) assess the impact of competition on recent growth in linear regression models. The logistic mortality model that we developed for mature stands classified an average of nearly 80% of the 119 trees from one site correctly as being dead or alive. While more than 50% of the variability of recent growth of living trees can be attributed to the influence of competition, this percentage was only 25% for standing dead trees. The predictive power of the logistic mortality model was validated successfully at two additional sites, where 29 of 41 (71%) and 34 of 42 (81%) trees were classified correctly, respectively. This supports the generality of the mortality model for Norway spruce in subalpine forests of the Alps. We conclude that growth trends in addition to the commonly used growth level significantly improve the prediction of growth-dependent tree mortality of Norway spruce.},

In contrast to these climatically-incited disturbances, little is known about the more direct effect of drought on tree mortality, especially in high-elevation forests. Therefore projections of drought-induced mortality under future climatic conditions remain uncertain. For a subalpine forest landscape in the Rocky Mountains of northern Colorado (USA), we quantified lag effects of drought on mortality of Engelmann spruce Picea engelmannii, subalpine fir Abies lasiocarpa, and lodgepole pine Pinus contorta. For the period 1910-2004, we related death dates of 164 crossdated dead trees to early-season and late-season droughts. Following early-season droughts, spruce mortality increased over five years and fir mortality increased sharply over 11 years. Following late-season droughts, spruce showed a small increase in mortality within one year, whereas fir showed a consistent period of increased mortality over two years. Pine mortality was not affected by drought. Low pre-drought radial growth rates predisposed spruce and fir to drought-related mortality. Spruce and fir trees that died during a recent drought (2000-2004) had significantly lower pre-drought growth rates than live neighbour trees. Overall, we found large interspecific differences in drought-related mortality with fir showing the strongest effect followed by spruce and pine. This direct influence of climatic variability on differential tree mortality has the potential for driving large-scale changes in subalpine forests of the Rocky Mountains.},

The equation form for each species was selected from 18 modified versions of the combined variable volume equation (Spurr 1952) which took into account changes in stem form with tree size in order to minimize bias within any specified diameter class in volume prediction. A weight function was used to obtain confidence curves for prediction error over the entire range of diameter in the data for each species. This method overcomes the shortcomings of the commonly used segmented approach of dividing data into diameter classes when evaluating prediction accuracy. In practice, the confidence curves can be used to derive confidence limits for stand volume or any product category when they are estimated from individual trees.},

  abstract = {We used data from 142 stands in Colorado and Wyoming, USA, to test the expectations of a model of growth dominance and stand development. Growth dominance relates the distribution of growth rates of individual trees within a stand to tree sizes. Stands with large trees that account for a greater share of stand growth than of stand mass exhibit strong growth dominance. Stands with large trees that contribute less to stand growth than to stand mass show reverse growth dominance. The four-phase model predicts that forests move from a period of little dominance (Phase 1), with trees accounting for similar contributions to stand growth and stand mass. Phase 2 is a period of strong growth dominance, where larger trees account for a disproportionately large amount of total stand growth. Growth dominance declines during Phase 3 as growth of the larger trees slows. A final Phase 4 shows reverse growth dominance when the growth of larger trees is less than their proportional contribution to total stand mass. The datasets supported the expectation of reverse growth dominance in old forests of ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and mixed stands of aspen and conifers. Pure aspen stands did not show reverse growth dominance. An age sequence of lodgepole pine failed to show the expected Phase 2 period of strongly developed growth dominance. Future work needs to combine quantitative descriptions of patterns in growth dominance with experimental manipulations of resource supplies and environmental conditions to connect forest dynamics at the scales of individual trees, groups of trees, and stands.

  abstract = {The growth of wood in trees and forests depends on the acquisition of resources (light, water, and nutrients), the efficiency of using resources for photosynthesis, and subsequent partitioning to woody tissues. Patterns of efficiency over time for individual trees, or between trees at one time, result from changes in rates photosynthesis and shifts in the relative partitioning to wood. We measured the production ecology (stem growth, light interception, and light use efficiency) to explain patterns of growth among trees within plots through stand development, and tested three hypotheses: (1) dominant trees have higher light use efficiency than subordinate trees; (2) lower variation in the size distribution of trees within plots allows higher light use efficiency; and (3) uniform stand structure and high light use efficiency reduce the age-related decline in tree growth. The experiment used clonal plantations of Eucalyptus at four locations in eastern Brazil. Irrigation and fertilization treatments ensured the major resource limitation for tree growth would be light supply. The influence of variation in the sizes of trees within plots was tested by comparing plots with all trees planted in a single day (uniform treatment) with plots where planting was spread over 80 days (heterogeneous treatment). Light interception per tree was simulated with the MAESTRA model. Across sites, treatments and whole-rotation stand development, dominant trees showed higher rates of stem growth, light interception, and light use efficiency than subordinate trees (supporting the first hypothesis). For example, dominant trees (80th percentile rank) at the end of the rotation grew four-times faster than suppressed trees (20th percentile rank), as a result of 2.1-fold greater light interception, and 1.8-fold greater stem growth per unit of light interception. In some cases, greater variation among tree sizes within plots led to lower efficiency of light use by average-size trees, providing mixed evidence for the second hypothesis. Greater uniformity of sizes of trees within plots did not substantially mitigate the decline in stem growth from mid-rotation to the end of the rotation, refuting the third hypothesis. The high efficiency of dominant trees underscores the marginal contribution of subordinate trees to total stand growth, and should spur further work on thinning to increase growth and lengthen rotations for dominant trees.

It is an 800 x 400 m plot established in 1908 within pristine ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws. var. scopulorum) forest near Flagstaff, Arizona. I quantified decadal-scale growth trends of individual trees and of the entire stand from timber inventories repeated at 10-year intervals between 1920 and 1990. A mixed linear model for longitudinal data was used to test significance of temporal trends. Stand density increased throughout the 20th century because of successful regeneration pulses, active fire control, and no tree cutting. Aboveground growth rates of the stand as a whole did not change significantly from 1920 to 1990, but individual growth rates declined. Mixed linear model results indicated that decadal basal area increment of large pines declined more than that of small pines. In 1920-1930 large pines were growing faster than small pines, but by 1980-1990 large pines were growing slower than small pines. Since the number of small pines multiplied and the number of large pines changed slightly, I inferred that competition for resources was more detrimental for large pines than for small pines.},

  abstract = {Historical information on forest growth is essential to evaluate and understand change in managed and unmanaged forests. Two ground-truth nondestructive sources of information on interannual to interdecadal changes are (a) repeated timber inventories and (b) tree-ring chronologies. I present here a case study of how those two types of data can complement and benefit each other. At the Gus Pearson Research Natural Area, a ponderosa pine stand near Flagstaff (Arizona, USA), timber inventories were repeated by the U.S. Forest Service from 1920 to 1990. The analysis of those data has revealed a decline of individual tree growth over the 20th century, attributed to increased stand density. Monthly precipitation and temperature at the study area showed no overall trend from 1910 to 1990. Tree-ring data collected at the area after 1990, and spanning the last few centuries, were compared to the inventory data to represent growth trends. Periodic basal area increment computed from forest inventories showed parallel trends but higher absolute values (especially for small pines) than periodic basal area increment computed from increment cores. Among selected ways of developing a tree-ring chronology, average ring area closely matched repeated forest inventories for 20th century trends and revealed that decadal-scale growth rates in the 1900s have been anomalous compared to the previous 300 years. The mensurational and dendrochronological approaches to forest monitoring showed advantages and disadvantages. Repeated forest inventories quantified growth of individual trees and of the entire stand, thus providing a complete picture, even in retrospect; but they had longer-than-annual resolution, and covered only the last decades. Dendrochronological data quantified annual xylem growth of individual trees over their whole life span, thus placing recent growth trends into a much longer historical perspective; but they had limited spatial coverage and could lead to different trends depending on the type of standardization option. Overall, the combination of both approaches is recommended for evaluating changes of forest growth at multiannual scales.},

  abstract = {Biotic interactions drive key ecological and evolutionary processes and mediate ecosystem responses to climate change. The direction, frequency, and intensity of biotic interactions can in turn be altered by climate change. Understanding the complex interplay between climate and biotic interactions is thus essential for fully anticipating how ecosystems will respond to the fast rates of current warming, which are unprecedented since the end of the last glacial period. We highlight episodes of climate change that have disrupted ecosystems and trophic interactions over time scales ranging from years to millennia by changing species' relative abundances and geographic ranges, causing extinctions, and creating transient and novel communities dominated by generalist species and interactions. These patterns emerge repeatedly across disparate temporal and spatial scales, suggesting the possibility of similar underlying processes. Based on these findings, we identify knowledge gaps and fruitful areas for research that will further our understanding of the effects of climate change on ecosystems.},

  abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

  abstract = {Climatic warming may lead to increased or decreased future forest productivity. However, more frequent heat waves, droughts and storms and accompanying pathogen attacks are also expected for Europe and are considered to be increasingly important abiotic and biotic stress factors for forests. Adaptive forestry can help forest ecosystems to adapt to these new conditions in order to achieve management goals, maintain desired forest ecosystem services and reduce the risks of forest degradation. With a focus on central Europe, this paper presents the following management strategies: (1) conservation of forest structures, (2) active adaptation, and (3) passive adaptation. The feasibility and criteria for application of the different strategies are discussed. Forest adaptation may entail the establishment of oneonativeo forests, including the use and intermixing of native and non-native tree species as well as non-local tree provenances that may adapt better to future climate conditions. An integrative adaptive management concept is proposed that combines (1) species suitability tests and modelling activities at the international scale, (2) priority mapping of adaptation strategies at the national to regional scale, and (3) implementation at the local scale. To achieve this, an international experimental trial system is required to test suitable adaptive measures throughout Europe and worldwide.},

  abstract = {In the framework of sustainable forest management, measuring site quality and predicting site productivity remain a major forestry topic. Over the past years, it has been fostered by a number of site-growth modelling studies seeking to establish quantitative relationships between site index and explicit biophysical indicators. In addition, comparative modelling studies of site index and site productivity have highlighted limited accordance of their environmental determinism, questioning site index as a reliable indicator of site quality. Lastly, process-based modelling approaches have recently arisen as a means to predict site productivity over large regions. All these investigations have however drawn limited attention in recent syntheses. In this review, we provide an overview of the literature on these site-growth studies. Concepts and vocabulary related to site productivity are introduced. Taking regional studies as a baseline, we first highlight recent progress regarding the geographic areas encompassed, and the major role played by NFI programmes and spatialized environmental information. A trade-off between model accuracy and geographic extent is suggested, pointing out potential deficiencies in the modelling of site-growth associations, insufficient accuracy or resolution in climatic data, or uncontrolled factors in site-growth models that emerge on a higher spatial scale. Inappropriate use of biophysical classifications where environmental factors remain implicit is also emphasized. In a next step, we discuss early and most recent indications on weaknesses of the site index concept when applied over large regions, including its differential response to climate relative to site productivity, regional variations in site index curves, site index dependence on stand density and subsequently on regional silvicultural practices. The role of genetic structure of tree populations and its integration into site-growth studies is also reviewed and discussed. The interests, limits and recent advances of process-based models as an alternative to evaluate site productivity are considered, as they may overcome some of the previous limitations. We last draw challenges and perspectives on the issue. We suggest that the accuracy and the need of site index as a founding concept of forestry science is questioned, by building direct productivityenvironment relationships based on NFI databases as a realistic option at hand. We formulate perspectives regarding the accuracy, resolution and enlargement of environmental indicators currently used, the inclusion of information on genetic structure of tree populations in the context of adaptation to future climate change, as well as the use of site productivity models in forest management.},

The aims of the study were to present an original non-asymptotic growth model and to test its accuracy against asymptotic-size equations. The equation proposed is a first-order four-parameter autonomous differential equation. The related sigmoid size curve has a parabolic branch of time. It was tested on 349 old growth series of top height (1047 stem analyses) selected to explore the maximum observed ranges of age and site conditions in seven temperate tree species growing in pure and even-aged stands. The fitting accuracy of this equation and three classical asymptotic-size growth equations (Richards, Hossfeld IV and Korf equations) were compared, with parameterizations of increasing flexibility. For the different parameterizations, the proposed growth equation showed higher performances than asymptotic growth equations, attributed to its non-asymptotic property and to the mathematical independence between parameters related to the inflection point and late growth. Top height growth was therefore accurately modelled by a sigmoid curve not based on the asymptotic-size assumption. This equation may be of general relevance to tree growth modelling.},

  abstract = {Dendrochronological methods have greatly contributed to the documentation of past long-term trends in forest growth. As these methods primarily focus on the high-frequency signals of tree ring chronologies, they require the removal of the ageing trend in tree growth, known as 'standardisation' or 'detrending', as a prerequisite to the estimation of such trends. Because the approach is sequential, it may however absorb part of the low-frequency historical signal. In this study, we investigate the effect of a sequential and a simultaneous estimation of the ageing trend on the chronology of growth. We formerly developed a method to estimate historical changes in growth, including a careful control of site fertility in the sampling design and a simultaneous separation of the site fertility, developmental stage, and calendar year effects on growth, using a statistical modelling (SM) approach. The method has been applied to the radial growth of dominant trees in even-aged stands of common beech in north-eastern France. We compare the SM method to the regional curve standardisation (RCS) method, which is widely used in dendrochronology, and has been proven to retain more long-term signals than other detrending techniques. We also test a variant of the RCS in which the developmental stage is measured by size rather than age, as is the case in the SM approach. The SM and RCS methods produce similar long-term chronologies, showing an increase of approximately 50% in radial growth over the 20th century and a recent decline of around 18% in magnitude. The negative bias induced by the sequential estimation of ageing and date effects on growth in the RCS is identified, but remains minor. The chronology estimated using the RCS variant (regional size curve) is lower in magnitude than that estimated using the RCS, but the difference is moderate (5%). These results highlight the conservative properties of the RCS with regard to the low-frequency historical signals in growth. They also suggest that singularly high estimates of growth trends reported in the dendrochronology literature are not method-dependent. We hypothesize that they may be caused by a negative site-age linkage in sampling designs. The decline reported for common beech in this temperate area of France is lower in magnitude than that evidenced in Mediterranean contexts. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {While forest productivity is usually inferred from height growth indices, retrospective analyses of tree rings have been intensively used to assess long-term trends in forest productivity. However, radial growth is sensitive to the degree of competition between trees and influenced by management practices or local disturbances. Whether radial growth is accurate for diagnosing and quantifying productivity changes remains a debated question. In a previous study (Bontemps et al., 2009), we assessed historical variations in dominant height growth of even-aged stands of common beech in north-eastern France as a proxy for their productivity changes. The analysis was based on a sampling design including 14 pairs of young/old (75/150 yr) neighbour stands growing under the same site conditions. Dominant height was reconstructed from stem analyses and was compared between generations using a statistical modelling procedure. In this analysis, we tested whether radial and height growth of dominant trees may provide compatible indications on long-term trends. We therefore measured and analysed the radial growth of dominant trees at breast height for the same sampled trees. The effects of site, developmental stage, and calendar date were separated by applying a similar modelling approach. Consideration of the developmental stage effect led to the formulation of an original growth equation. Analysis of radial growth revealed: (i) a long-term positive increase; (ii) a magnitude of +50% over the last century; and (iii) growth declines in the 1940s and 1990s. These features were remarkably similar to those reported on dominant height, and indicated that radial growth of dominant trees delivered a sound picture of productivity changes. The radial growth chronology also differed by showing a more acute acceleration phase in the early century, and a recent but significant difference between stand generations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Environmental drivers of forest productivity increases have been much debated. Evidence for the suggested role of increasing nitrogen supply is lacking over long-term time scales. Tracking the footprint of environmental factors by using long-term growth records may thus prove decisive. We analysed growth chronologies of common beech in two areas of contrasting nutritional status in France. Dominant height growth was used as a proxy for productivity. Growth was compared between old and young paired stands sampled at the same sites to factor out effects of ageing and site. Growth chronologies were estimated with a statistical modelling procedure. The environmental causality of growth changes was addressed by combining (1) a comparison of growth changes between regions, (2) a regional comparison of growth chronologies with chronologies of environmental factors and (3) growth-environment relationships established from climate/soil data. Historical growth increases followed very similar courses in the two areas. Remarkably, the magnitude of change was 50% lower in the area that had reduced nutritional status and nitrogen deposition. Historical variations in environmental factors and growth were congruent with the roles of nitrogen availability and deposition, and of atmospheric CO(2) increase. Low-frequency variations in climate and growth were not coincident. However, our analysis demonstrated the role of climatic anomalies in short-term growth variations. Growth-environment relationships further indicated a nitrogen constraint. These observations corroborate the enhancing role of increased nitrogen availability on forest biomass accumulation previously reported in ecosystem experiments and process-based modelling explorations.},

  abstract = {The phenotypic responses of suppressed trees were studied in a 60?year?old white pine stand. The first evidence of suppression is a tree?wide decrease in the production of secondary xylem. Height growth is relatively insensitive. During the latter 30 years of life suppressed trees made 50.7% of their total height growth but only 19.1% of their total diameter growth. Eventually the cambium fails to cut off xylem at the base of the tree. With time, the sheath of new?formed xylem retreats from the based giving rise to an increasingly large zone of missing rings. Girdling experiments indicate that diminished supplies of food and growth regulators move through the zone of missing rings to support primary root growth. Apparently the phloem remains functional in the zone of missing rings. Either the phloem can function for periods greater than 1 or 2 years, or the cambium cuts off phloem alone in the missing ring zone. In the normal cambial cycle, phloem alone is produced during the last part of the growing season. It is proposed that a physiological threshold exists below which growth conditions are inadequate for the production of secondary xylem but remain favorable for the production of primary root growth and possibly for secondary phloem. This physiological mechanism is of considerable ecological significance since, as suppression proceeds, the plant invests a higher and higher proportion of its decreasing energy supply in primary growth or in all tissues that require annual renewal thus prolonging its survival. Hence, the growth of white pine, while undergoing suppression, illustrates the principle of phenotypic adaptability. See full-text article at JSTOR},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate tree-ring width variability and to distinguish groups of trees with similar growth trends in order to study tree growth responses to various stand and site conditions. The methods of cluster analysis were employed for this purpose. Four distinct groups of trees were identified. For each group, the mean tree-ring curve was calculated in order to look for the main signals that distinguish the groups from one another. The idea behind this was to divide the samples into homogeneous groups with similar growth trends, representing typical examples of variability of the studied Norway spruce population. In the next step, several regression functions were studied and compared for their ability to fit the ring-width-age data applied to the mean ring-width curve of each group. Fischer's F-test was used to test the differences in goodness of fit between the equations in each group. From all examined/applied equations, smoothing spline, polynomial of degree 5, and Smelko-Burgan functions were found to be the most universal and suitable for detrending of all examined ring width curves. Hugershoff function was found to be suitable for curves with one local maximum only. Exponential and Korf's functions were unsatisfactory for the purposes of tree ring curves detrending.},

  abstract = {The relationship between basal-area increment and stem-volume increment or biomass annual production was investigated in 30 dominant European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in northeastern France. The trees were sampled at four heights along the stem for dendrochronological and densitometric measurements. Annual stem-volume and stem-biomass increments were computed from the measurements and were not obtained by applying allometric relationships. A comparison of the ring-area increments at the four stem heights indicated that the vertical distribution of annual growth fluctuates at an interannual time step and is influenced by climate during the growing season, particularly drought events. Ring-area increments were more strongly reduced at breast height than in the upper parts of the tree during dry years. Relationships between basal-area increment and volume or annual biomass production were very strong, but the residuals of these relationhips contained up to 50% climate information. The amplitude of the breast-height radial-growth response to drought is much larger than the volume and biomass-production responses. Variations of wood density in this diffuse-porous species are not large enough to consistently modify the estimates of annual stem biomass production. Breast-height series are a valuable tool for dendrochronological investigations, but as they are more sensitive to drought, they greatly underestimate tree biomass increments during drought episodes.},

Few studies have investigated the genetics of plasticity in response to density for growth traits such as height and circumference through development.• Methods Two experiments were carried out in the field, the first with full-sib families of Eucalyptus urophylla × E. grandis hybrids, and the second with clones of E. tereticornis × E. grandis hybrids planted across a range of densities (625, 1111 and 2500 trees ha−1). Height, circumference and stem taper were measured through development in both experiments. Variance components were estimated and a repeated measure approach for plasticity and three different methods were used to compare the variance–covariance matrix across densities.• Key Results Genetic variance was significantly different from zero but the density × genotype interaction was significant only for clone experiments at the adult stage. Significant plasticity for three traits in both experiments was found. In the clone experiments, a significant clone × time × density interaction was found, suggesting that plasticity for growth and stem form is under genetic control. In both experiments, density did not affect environmental correlation, which remained high throughout tree development. The impact of density on genetic correlation was marked in the clone experiment, with a reduced value at lower density, but was not observed in the family trial. The differences between clones and family are mainly explained by the distribution of genetic variation within and among genotypes.• Conclusions The results suggest that plasticity for growth traits and form of tropical Eucalyptus species is under genetic control and that the environment changes genetic co-variation through ontogeny. The findings confirm that a tree population with a narrow genetic basis (represented by clones) is sensitive to a changing environment, whereas a population with a broader genetic basis (full-sib family here) exhibits a more stable reaction.},

  abstract = {Forest ecosystem processes depend on local interactions that are modified by the spatial pattern of trees and resources. Effects of resource supplies on processes such as regeneration are increasingly well understood, yet we have few tools to compare resource heterogeneity among forests that differ in structural complexity. We used a neighborhood approach to examine understory light and nutrient availability in a well-replicated and large-scale variable-retention harvesting experiment in a red pine forest in Minnesota, USA. The experiment included an unharvested control and three harvesting treatments with similar tree abundance but different patterns of retention (evenly dispersed as well as aggregated retention achieved by cutting 0.1- or 0.3-ha gaps). We measured light and soil nutrients across all treatments and mapped trees around each sample point to develop an index of neighborhood effects (NI). Field data and simulation modeling were used to test hypotheses that the mean and heterogeneity of resource availability would increase with patchiness because of greater variation in competitive environments. Our treatments dramatically altered the types and abundances of competitive neighborhoods (NI) in each stand and resulted in significantly nonlinear relationships of light, nitrogen and phosphorus availability to NI. Hence, the distribution of neighborhoods in each treatment had a significant impact on resource availability and heterogeneity. In dense control stands, neighborhood variation had little impact on resource availability, whereas in more open stands (retention treatments), it had large effects on light and modest effects on soil nutrients. Our results demonstrate that tree spatial pattern can affect resource availability and heterogeneity in explainable and predictable ways, and that neighborhood models provide a useful tool for scaling heterogeneity from the individual tree to the stand. These insights are needed to anticipate the outcomes of silvicultural manipulations and should become more holistically integrated into both basic ecological and management science.},

  abstract = {Many mountain forests in the European Alps protect people and assets against natural hazards such as snow avalanches. These forests are mainly managed to ensure continuous and effective protection. Silvicultural operations should make protection forests as resistant as possible to natural disturbing agents such as wind that have the potential to impair effective protection, and they should increase their elasticity, i.e. speed of recovery once disturbances have impaired the protective effect. However, current management approaches do not yet consistently focus on enhancing resistance and elasticity in the face of multiple disturbances. Moreover, they use a stand level approach instead of an ecosystem-based approach. These shortcomings can be overcome by explicitly integrating resistance and elasticity into forest management. In this paper, the meaning of resistance and elasticity is clarified and illustrated with examples. A procedure to integrate resistance and elasticity into forest management is presented, with the five steps: Identification of disturbances and slow undesirable changes, identification of characteristics relevant to the resistance and elasticity of a forest to disturbances, identification of variables for monitoring these characteristics, establishment of target values for each variable, and implementation including monitoring. Suggestions to quantify resistance and elasticity are made. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this review, we identify and evaluate six principles for enhancing the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests in a changing climate: (1) increase tree species richness, (2) increase structural diversity, (3) maintain and increase genetic variation within tree species, (4) increase resistance of individual trees to biotic and abiotic stress, (5) replace high-risk stands and (6) keep average growing stocks low. We use these principles to examine how three CNS systems (single-tree selection, group selection and shelterwood) serve adaptation strategies. Many attributes of CNS can increase the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests to a changing climate. CNS promotes structural diversity and tree resistance to stressors, and growing stocks can be kept at low levels. However, some deficiencies exist in relation to the adaptation principles of increasing tree species richness, maintaining and increasing genetic variation, and replacing high-risk stands. To address these shortcomings, CNS should make increased use of a range of regeneration methods, in order to promote light-demanding tree species, non-native species and non-local provenances.},

Under this assumption we analysed two simple models that relate cross-sectional growth to the growth of stem length above the cross section in four species of Mediterranean pines. Cross-sectional growth was measured at breast height. The first model (Model 0) has no parameters, and specifies an isometric relationship between cross-sectional area and stem length. The second model (Model α), which was formulated to analyse Model 0, has one parameter. Neither of the two simple models requires knowledge of crown length, though Model 0 derives – under an assumption of constant crown length – from a more general model that relates cross-sectional growth to crown length dynamics. A mixed-effects modelling strategy was selected to fit Model α in order to incorporate fixed effects of species, and random effects to account for factors like ontogeny (tree effect), stand history (plot effect) and climatic conditions (growth period). Results indicate that Model α predicts better than Model 0 when the single parameter is expanded to take into account all these effects and indicate that the constant ratio between cross-sectional area and the length of stem predicted by Model 0 is one possible value within a ratio that changes over time as function of ontogeny, stand history and climatic conditions. On average the ratio is positive, indicating greater cross-sectional growth than height growth showing greater variation in stem formation. Inter-specific analysis indicated a less asymmetric behaviour in competition for pine species growing in water-stress environment},

Forest tree response can be analysed using dendroecological methods, as tree-ring widths are strongly controlled by climatic or biotic events. Years with such events induce similar tree responses and are called pointer years. They can result from extreme climatic events like frost, a heat wave, spring water logging, drought or insect damage… Forest tree species showed contrasting responses to climatic hazards, depending on their sensitivity to water shortage or temperature hardening, as illustrated from our dendrochronological database. For foresters, a drought or a pest disease is an extreme event if visible and durable symptoms are induced (leaf discolouration, leaf loss, perennial organs mortality, tree dieback and mortality). These symptoms here are shown, lagging one or several years behind a climatic or biotic event, from forest decline cases in progress since the 2003 drought or attributed to previous severe droughts or defoliations in France. Tree growth or vitality recovery is illustrated, and the functional interpretation of the long lasting memory of trees is discussed. A coupled approach linking dendrochronology and ecophysiology helps in discussing vulnerability of forest stands, and suggests management advices in order to mitigate extreme drought and cope with selective mortality.},

They also had the same percent loss of conductivity (= 80%) in petioles at maximal drought intensity when midday leaf water potential had dropped to = -3.0 MPa. Finally, good agreement was found between observed losses of hydraulic conductivity during in situ dehydration and the vulnerability curves obtained under laboratory conditions. The shifts in maximal conductivity observed in some droughted trees probably accentuated discrepancies between field and laboratory data. However, a correction procedure helped overcome these artifacts. },

  abstract = {To quantify the effects of crown thinning on the water balance and growth of the stand and to analyze the ecophysiological modifications induced by canopy opening on individual tree water relations, we conducted a thinning experiment in a 43-year-old Quercus petraea stand by removing trees from the upper canopy level. Soil water content, rainfall interception, sap flow, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance were monitored for two seasons following thinning. Seasonal time courses of leaf area index (LAI) and girth increment were also measured.Predawn leaf water potential was significantly higher in trees in the thinned stand than in the closed stand, as a consequence of higher relative extractable water in the soil. The improvement in water availability in the thinned stand resulted from decreases in both interception and transpiration. From Year 1 to Year 2, an increase in transpiration was observed in the thinned stand without any modification in LAI, whereas changes in transpiration in the closed stand were accompanied by variations in LAI. The different behaviors of the closed and open canopies were interpreted in terms of coupling to the atmosphere. Thinning increased inter-tree variability in sap flow density, which was closely related to a leaf area competition index. Stomatal conductance varied little inside the crown and differences in stomatal conductance between the treatments appeared only during a water shortage and affected mainly the closed stand. Thinning enhanced tree growth as a result of a longer growing period due to the absence of summer drought and higher rates of growth. Suppressed and dominant trees benefited more from thinning than trees in the codominant classes.},

Root densities of each species were described in situ. Soil water contents and potentials, and pre-dawn leaf water potentials ( psi wp) were monitored during three successive years. Soil water retention characteristics were obtained from field measurements of water potential and water content. The decreasing rooting density with depth was strongly related to soil physical properties. The root system was separated into two compartments by a layer with a high clay content. The deepest soil compartment was mainly explored by fine roots. Neutron probe measurements allowed the detection of variations in water content down to a depth of 2 m. The distribution of water uptake among the different soil layers changed when drought increased. Water was extracted from the deepest reservoir, and capillary rises even occurred after partial water depletion in the upper part of the soil. Seasonal trends of pre-dawn leaf water potential generally matched those of soil water potential in the wettest rooted zone, which was at -140 cm. In the upper, dry, horizons, the marked loss of soil hydraulic conductivity diminished water transport to roots leading to an impossible equilibrium between roots and soil at pre-dawn. Low sensitivity was presented by psi wp to variations of total soil water content between 40% and 100% of extractable water. Below this threshold, psi wp decreased markedly to a minimal value of approx equal to -2.0 MPa.},

  abstract = {The extreme drought event that occurred in Western Europe during 2003 highlighted the need to understand the key processes that may allow trees and stands to overcome such severe water shortages. We therefore reviewed the current knowledge available about such processes. First, impact of drought on exchanges at soil-root and canopy-atmosphere interfaces are presented and illustrated with examples from water and CO2 flux measurements. The decline in transpiration and water uptake and in net carbon assimilation due to stomatal closure has been quantified and modelled. The resulting models were used to compute water balance at stand level basing on the 2003 climate in nine European forest sites from the CARBOEUROPE network. Estimates of soil water deficit were produced and provided a quantitative index of soil water shortage and therefore of the intensity of drought stress experienced by trees during summer 2003. In a second section, we review the irreversible damage that could be imposed on water transfer within trees and particularly within xylem. A special attention was paid to the inter-specific variability of these properties among a wide range of tree species. The inter-specific diversity of hydraulic and stomatal responses to soil water deficit is also discussed as it might reflect a large diversity in traits potentially related to drought tolerance. Finally, tree decline and mortality due to recurrent or extreme drought events are discussed on the basis of a literature review and recent decline studies. The potential involvement of hydraulic dysfunctions or of deficits in carbon storage as causes for the observed long term ( several years) decline of tree growth and development and for the onset of tree dieback is discussed. As an example, the starch content in stem tissues recorded at the end of the 2003' s summer was used to predict crown conditions of oak trees during the following spring: low starch contents were correlated with large twig and branch decline in the crown of trees.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring chronologies that represent annual changes in the density of wood formed during the late summer can provide a proxy for local summertime air temperature(1). Here we undertake an examination of large-regional-scale wood-density/air-temperature relationships using measurements from hundreds of sites at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. When averaged over large areas of northern America and Eurasia, tree-ring density series display a strong coherence with summer temperature measurements averaged over the same areas, demonstrating the ability of this proxy to portray mean temperature changes over sub-continents and even the whole Northern Hemisphere. During the second half of the twentieth century, the decadal-scale trends in wood density and summer temperatures have increasingly diverged as wood density has progressively fallen. The cause of this increasing insensitivity of wood density to temperature changes is not known, but if it is not taken into account in dendroclimatic reconstructions, past temperatures could be overestimated. Moreover, the recent reduction in the response of trees to air-temperature changes would mean that estimates of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, based on carbon-cycle models that are uniformly sensitive to high-latitude warming, could be too low.},

In a wind-exposed Sitka spruce stand in western Scotland, 60 trees at four different levels of wind exposure (10 m, 30 m, 50 m, 90 m from edge) were characterized for stem and crown size and shape and mechanical properties, including structural Young's modulus (Estruct), natural frequency, and damping ratio. Estruct increased from the stand edge to the mid-forest, but with a large inter-tree variation. Swaying frequency and damping ratio of the trees also increased with distance from edge. Wind-exposed edge trees grew shorter, but more tapered with an overall lower Estruct, allowing for greater flexural stiffness at the stem base due to the larger diameter and for higher flexibility in the crown region of the stem. The trees at the middle of the stand compensated for their increased slenderness with a higher Estruct. Thus, for the different requirements for wind-firmness at stand edge and mid-forest, an adapted combination of tree form and mechanical properties allows the best withstanding of wind loads. The results show the requirement to understand the different strategies of trees to adapt to environmental constraints and the heterogeneity of their growth reactions in response to these strategies.},

  abstract = {We analyzed growth responses to climate of 24 tree-ring width and four maximum latewood density chronologies from the greater Tatra region in Poland and Slovakia. This network comprises 1183 ring-width and 153 density measurement series from four conifer species (Picea abies (L.) Karst., Larix decidua Mill., Abies alba (L.) Karst., and Pinus mugo (L.)) between 800 and 1550 m a.s.l. Individual spline detrending was used to retain annual to multi-decadal scale climate information in the data. Twentieth century temperature and precipitation data frorn 16 grid-boxes covering the 48-50 degrees N and 19-21 degrees E region were used for comparison. The network was analyzed to assess growth responses to climate as a function of species, elevation, parameter, frequency and site ecology. Twenty ring-width chronologies significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with June-July temperatures, whereas the latewood density chronologies were correlated with the April-September temperatures. Climatic effects of the previous-year summer generally did not significantly influence ring formation, whereas site elevation and frequency of growth variations (i.e., inter-annual and decadal) were significant variables in explaining growth response to climate. Response to precipitation increased with decreasing elevation. Correlations between summer temperatures and annual growth rates were lower for Larix decidua than for Picea abies. Principal component analysis identified five dominant eigenvectors that express somewhat contrasting climatic signals. The first principal component contained highest loadings from I I Picea abies ring-width chronologies and one Pinus mugo ring-width chronology and explained 42% of the network's variance. The mean of these 12 high-elevation chronologies was significantly correlated at 0.62 with June-July temperatures, whereas the mean of three latewood density chronologies, which loaded most strongly on the fourth principal component, significantly correlated at 0.69 with April-September temperatures (P < 0.001 over the 1901-2002 period in both cases). These groupings allow for a robust estimation of June-July (1661-2004) and April-September (1709-2004) temperatures, respectively. Comparison with reconstructions from the Alps and Central Europe supports the general rule of the dominant influence of growing season temperature on high-elevation forest growth.},

  abstract = {A new Norway spruce ( Picea abies ( L.) Karst.) tree-ring width chronology based on living and historic wood spanning the AD 1108-2003 period is developed. This composite record combines 208 high elevation samples from 3 Swiss subalpine valleys, i.e., Lotschental, Goms, and Engadine. To retain potential high- to low-frequency information in this dataset, individual spline detrending and the regional curve standardization are applied. For comparison, 22 high elevation and 6 low-elevation instrumental station records covering the greater Alpine area are used. Previous year August-September precipitation and current year May-July temperatures control spruce ring width back to similar to 1930. Decreasing ( increasing) moving correlations with monthly mean temperatures ( precipitation) indicate instable growth/climate response during the 1760 2002 period. Crucial June-August temperatures before similar to 1900 shift towards May-July temperature plus August precipitation sensitivity after similar to 1900. Numerous of comparable subalpine spruce chronologies confirm increased late-summer drought stress, coincidently with the recent warming trend. Comparison with regional-, and large-scale millennial-long temperature reconstructions reveal significant similarities prior to similar to 1900 ( 1300-1900 mean r=0.51); however, this study does not fully capture the commonly reported 20th century warming ( 1900-1980 mean r=-0.17). Due to instable growth/climate response of the new spruce chronology, further dendroclimatic reconstruction is not performed.},

  abstract = {Evidence for reduced sensitivity of tree growth to temperature has been reported from multiple forests along the high northern latitudes. This alleged circumpolar phenomenon described the apparent inability of temperature-sensitive tree-ring width and density chronologies to parallel increasing instrumental temperature measurements since the mid-20th century. In addition to such low-frequency trend offset, the inability of formerly temperature-sensitive tree growth to reflect high-frequency temperature signals in a warming world is indicated at some boreal sites, mainly in Alaska, the Yukon and Siberia. Here, we refer to both of these findings as the 'divergence problem' (DP), with their causes and scale being debated. If DP is widespread and the result of climatic forcing, the overall reliability of tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions should be questioned. Testing for DP benefits from well-replicated tree-ring and instrumental data spanning from the 19th to the 21st century. Here, we present a network of 124 larch and spruce sites across the European Alpine arc. Tree-ring width chronologies from 40 larch and 24 spruce sites were selected based on their correlation with early (1864-1933) instrumental temperatures to assess their ability of tracking recent (1934-2003) temperature variations. After the tree-ring series of both species were detrended in a manner that allows low-frequency variations to be preserved and scaled against summer temperatures, no unusual late 20th century DP is found. Independent tree-ring width and density evidence for unprecedented late 20th century temperatures with respect to the past millennium further reinforces our results.},

Height and diameter growth were measured and analysed and the quality of tree stems was recorded. Sampled seeds originated from certified stands for seed production located in the Hercynian and Carpathian regions of the Czech Republic. Differences between the two species result from their ecological requirements. A comparison of the two species indicates that pedunculate oak at young age grows better than sessile oak in its typical site conditions. Sessile oak grows relatively worse on the plots situated in floodplain site conditions because it does not tolerate the high levels of groundwater. But the differences were not statistically significant. Significant differences in growth parameters were confirmed within each species among plots and provenances. Large differences in stem shape quality were also recorded already in the early growth phase. In some provenances straight stems were present in up to 56% of the individuals, however, in others straight stems did not appear at all. The total results showed that some pedunculate and sessile oak provenances are more adaptable to site conditions and they suffer lower losses while achieving very good growth.},

A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling. Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems. The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

There is a clear philosophy a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a "savvy" prior on models that is a function of sample Size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

  abstract = {Rates of change in final summer densities of two desert annuals, Eriogunum abertianum and Haplopappus gracilis, as constrained by their initial winter germination densities were estimated with regression quantiles and compared with mechanistic fits based on a self-thinning rule proposed by Guo et al. (1998); Oikos 83: 237-245). The allometric relation used was equivalent to S = N-f (N-i)(-1) = c(f) (N-l)(-1), where S is the ratio of final to initial densities (survivorship), c(f) is a constant that is a final density specific to the species and environment. N-i is the initial plant density, and N-f is final plant density. We used regression quantiles to estimate c(f) assuming the exponent of -1 was fixed (model 1, N-f (N-i)(-1) = c(f) (N-i)(-1)) and also obtained estimates by treating the exponent as a parameter to estimate (model 2, N-f (N-i)(-1) = c(f) (N-i)(lambda)). Regression quantiles allow rates of change to be estimated through any part of a data distribution conditional on some linear function of covariates. We focused on estimates for upper (90-99th) quantiles near the boundary of the summer density distributions where we expected effects of self-thinning to operate as the primary constraint on plant performance. Allometric functions estimated with regression quantiles were similar to Functions fit by Guo et al. (1998) when the exponent was constrained to - 1. However, the data were more consistent with estimates for model (2), where exponents were closer to - 0.4 than - 1, although model fit was not as good at higher initial plant densities as when the exponent was fixed at - 1. An exponential form (model 3, N-f (N-i)(-1) = c(f) (N-i)(lambda)e(gamma Ni)) that is a generalization of the discrete logistic growth function, where estimates of lambda were - 0.23 to - 0.28 and estimates of gamma were - 0.003 to - 0.006, provided better lit from low to high initial germination densities. Model 3 predictions were consistent with an interpretation that final summer densities were constrained by initial germination densities when these were low ( < 40 per 0.25 m(2) for Eriogonum and < 100 per 0.25 m(2) for Haplopappus) and were constrained by the self-thinning process at higher germination densities. Our exponential model(3) estimated with regression quantiles had similar form to the mechanistic relation of Guo et al. (1998) when plotted as a survivorship function, but avoided the unrealistic assumption that all populations attained a similar final density, and was based on a statistical model that has formal rules for estimation and inference.},

Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution.

  abstract = {We simulated the effects of missing information on statistical distributions of animal response that covaried with measured predictors of habitat to evaluate the utility and performance of quantile regression for providing more useful intervals of uncertainty in habitat relationships. These procedures were evaulated for conditions in which heterogeneity and hidden bias were induced by confounding with missing variables associated with other improtant processes, a problem common in statistical modeling of ecological phenomena. Simulations for a large (N = 10000) finite population representing grid locations on a landscape demonstrated various forms of hidden bias that might occur when the effect of a measured habitat variable on some animal was confounded with the effect of another unmeasured variable. Quantile (0 <= tau <= 1) regression parameters for linear models that excluded the important, unmeasured variable revealed bias relative to parameters from the generating model. Depending on whether interactions of the measured and unmeasured variables were negative (interference interactions) or positive (facilitation interactions) in simulations without spatial structuring. either upper (tau > 0.5) or lower (tau < 0.5) quantile regression parameters were less biased than mean rate parameters. Heterogeneous, nonlinear response patterns Occurred with correlations between the measured and unmeasured variables. When the unmeasured variable was spatially structured. variation in parameters across quantiles associated with heterogeneous effects of the habitat variable was reduced by modeling the spatial trend surface as a cubic polynomial of location coordinates, but substantial hidden bias remained. Sampling (n = 20-300) simulations demonstrated that regression quantile estimates and confidence intervals constructed by invertin-weighted rank score tests provided valid coverage of these parameters. Local forms of quantile weighting were required for obtaining correct Type I error rates and confidence interval coverage. Quantile regression was used to estimate effects of physical habitat resources on a bivalve (Macomona liliana) in the spatially structured landscape on a sandflat in a New Zealand harbor. Confidence intervals around predicted 0.10 and 0.90 quantiles were used to estimate sampling intervals containing 80% of the variation in densities in relation to bed elevation. Spatially structured variation in bivalve counts estimated by a cubic polynomial trend surface remained after accounting for the nonlinear effects of bed elevation, indicating the existence of important spatially structured processes that were not adequately represented by the measured habitat variables.},

  abstract = {In a recent Concepts paper in Ecology, Thomson et al. emphasized that assumptions of conventional correlation and regression analyses fundamentally conflict with the ecological concept of limiting factors, and they called for new statistical procedures to address this problem. The analytical issue is that unmeasured factors may be the active limiting constraint and may induce a pattern of unequal variation in the biological response variable through an interaction with the measured factors. Consequently, changes near the maxima, rather than at the center of response distributions, are better estimates of the effects expected when the observed factor is the active limiting constraint. Regression quantiles provide estimates for linear models tit to any part of a response distribution, including near the upper bounds, and require minimal assumptions about the form of the error distribution. Regression quantiles extend the concept of one-sample quantiles to the linear model by solving an optimization problem of minimizing an asymmetric function of absolute errors. Rank-score tests for regression quantiles provide tests of hypotheses and confidence intervals for parameters in linear models with heteroscedastic errors, conditions likely to occur in models of limiting ecological relations. We used selected regression quantiles (e.g., 5th, 10th,..., 95th) and confidence intervals to test hypotheses that parameters equal zero for estimated changes in average annual acorn biomass due to forest canopy cover of oak (Quercus spp.) and oak species diversity. Regression quantiles also were used to estimate changes in glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) seedling numbers as a function of lily flower numbers, rockiness, and pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides fossor) activity, data that motivated the query by Thomson et al. for new statistical procedures. Both example applications showed that effects of limiting factors estimated by changes in some upper regression quantile (e.g., 90-95th) were greater than if effects were estimated by changes in the means from standard linear model procedures. Estimating a range of regression quantiles (e.g., 5-95th) provides a comprehensive description of biological response patterns for exploratory and inferential analyses in observational studies of limiting factors, especially when sampling large spatial and temporal scales.},

silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and common beech (Fagus
sylvatica L.), whose geographical distribution depends on
their low tolerance to summer drought at low altitude/latitude,
and low temperatures (late frost and short length of
the growing season) at high altitude/latitude. Firs and
beeches distributed along an elevational gradient were
investigated using dendroecological methods. Silver fir
growth was found to be more sensitive to summer water
stress than beech. On the other hand, beech growth was
more impacted by extreme events such as the 2003 heat
wave, and negatively related to earlier budburst, which
suggests a higher sensitivity to late frost. These results are
confirmed by the different altitudinal effects observed in
both species. Beech growth decreases with altitude whereas
an optimum of growth potential was observed at intermediate
elevations for silver fir. Recent global warming has
caused a significant upward shift of these optima. As found
for the period 2000–2006, rising temperatures and
decreasing rainfall may restrain growth of silver fir. If these
trends continue in the future beech might be favored at low
altitudes. The species will have a reduced capacity to
migrate to higher altitudes due to its sensitivity to late
frosts, although an upward shift of silver fir is likely.},

  abstract = {The individualistic nature of communities is held as a fundamental ecological tenet by many ecologists. The empirical rationale for the individualistic hypothesis is largely based on gradient analyses in which plant species are almost always found to be arranged independently of one another in ''continua'' along environmental gradients. However, continua are correlative patterns and do not identify the processes that determine them, and so they do not necessarily preclude the possibility of interdependent interactions within plant communities. For example, the common occurrence of positive interactions suggests that plant species may not always be distributed independently of each other. If the distributions and abundances of species are enhanced by the presence of other species, their organization is not merely a coincidence of similar adaptation to the abiotic environment. Interpretations of gradient analyses also appear to assume that interactions among species should be similar at all points along environmental axes, and that groups of species should be associated at all points on a gradient if interdependence is to be accepted. However, virtually all types of ecological interactions have been shown to vary with changes in the abiotic environment, and a number of field experiments indicate that positive effects become stronger as abiotic stress increases. Furthermore, interactions among plants have been shown to shift from competition to facilitation along environmental continua. Thus, significant interdependence may occur even when species do not fully overlap in distribution. Higher-order, indirect interactions between animals and plants, and among plants, also suggest that interdependence within communities occurs. Eliminating a species involved in an indirect interaction may not necessarily mean that its beneficiary will be eliminated from a community, but the prospect that the distribution and abundance of any species in a plant community may be positively affected by the effects that other species have on their competitors suggests that communities are organized by much more than ''the fluctuating and fortuitous immigration of plants and an equally fluctuating and variable environment'' as stated by Henry Gleason. The ubiquity of direct and indirect positive interactions within plant communities provides a strong argument that communities are more interdependent than current theories allow.},

  abstract = {Reviews of the current statuses of forests and the impacts of climate change on forests exist at the (sub)continental scale, but rarely at country and regional levels, meaning that information on causal factors, their impacts, and specific regional properties is often inconsistent and lacking in depth. Here, we present the current status of forest production and biogeochemistry and the expected impacts of climate change on them for Belgium. This work represents a case study for the temperate oceanic zone, the most important bioclimatic zone in northwestern Europe. Results show that Belgian forests are mainly young, very productive, and have a high C-sequestration capacity. Major negative anomalies in tree vitality were observed in the 1990s and-as result of disturbances-in the last decade for sensitive species as poplars and European beech. The most severe disturbances were caused by extreme climatic events, directly (e.g. storms) or indirectly (e.g. insect outbreaks after a mild autumn with an early/severe frost). Because of atmospheric deposition and soil fertilization (due to the previous use of the land), nutrient stocks of Belgian forests are likely to sustain the future enhancement in productivity which is expected to follow the increase in atmospheric CO(2) concentration that will occur in years to come. However, in the long term, such (enhanced) forest production is likely to be limited by nutrient deficiencies at poor sites and by drought for sensitive species such as beech and (particularly) Norway spruce. Drought conditions will likely increase in the future, but adverse effects are expected on a relatively limited number of tree species. The potential impacts of windstorms, insects and fungi should be carefully investigated, whereas fires are less of a concern.},

Our analyses also estimate inter- and intra-specific competition coefficients and explicitly partition the competitive effects of neighbors into the effects of shading versus crowding. We tested the method using data from forests of northern, interior British Columbia dominated by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). For both species, the most parsimonious regression models included terms for the effects of tree size, crowding, and shading and separate competitive effects of four different groups of competing species. The models explained 33%-59% of the variation in radial growth of the two species. For both species, growth declined more steeply as a function of crowding than shading. There was striking asymmetry in the strength of interspecific competition between hemlock and redcedar, with crowding by hemlock having a strong per capita effect on redcedar, while crowding by redcedar had relatively little effect on the radial growth of hemlock.},

  abstract = {We use permanent-plot data from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program for an analysis of the effects of competition on tree growth along environmental gradients for the 14 most abundant tree species in forests of northern New England, USA. Our analysis estimates actual growth for each individual tree of a given species as a function of average potential diameter growth modified by three sets of scalars that quantify the effects on growth of (1) initial target tree size (dbh), (2) local environmental conditions, and (3) crowding by neighboring trees. Potential growth of seven of the 14 species varied along at least one of the two environmental axes identified by an ordination of relative abundance of species in plots. The relative abundances of a number of species were significantly displaced from sites where they showed maximum potential growth. In all of these cases, abundance was displaced to the more resource-poor end of the environmental gradient (either low fertility or low moisture). The pattern was most pronounced among early successional species, whereas late-successional species reached their greatest abundance on sites where they also showed the highest growth in the absence of competition. The analysis also provides empirical estimates of the strength of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects of neighbors. For all but one of the species, our results led us to reject the hypothesis that all species of competitors have equivalent effects on a target species. Most of the individual pairwise interactions were strongly asymmetric. There was a clear competitive hierarchy among the four most shade-tolerant species, and a separate competitive hierarchy among the shade-intolerant species. Our results suggest that timber yield following selective logging will vary dramatically depending on the configuration of the residual canopy, because of interspecific variation in the magnitude of both the competitive effects of different species of neighbors and the competitive responses of different species of target trees to neighbors. The matrix of competition coefficients suggests that there may be clear benefits in managing for specific mixtures of species within local neighborhoods within stands.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing power in the past 20 years have led to a proliferation of spatially explicit, individual-based models of population and ecosystem dynamics. In forest ecosystems, the individual-based models encapsulate an emerging theory of "neighborhood" dynamics, in which fine-scale spatial interactions regulate the demography of component tree species. The spatial distribution of component species, in turn, regulates spatial variation in a whole host of community and ecosystem properties, with subsequent feedbacks on component species. The development of these models has been facilitated by development of new methods of analysis of field data, in which critical demographic rates and ecosystem processes are analyzed in terms of the spatial distributions of neighboring trees and physical environmental factors. The analyses are based on likelihood methods and information theory, and they allow a tight linkage between the models and explicit parameterization of the models from field data. Maximum. likelihood methods have a long history of use for point and interval estimation in statistics. In contrast, likelihood principles have only more gradually emerged in ecology as the foundation for an alternative to traditional hypothesis testing. The alternative framework stresses the process of identifying and selecting among competing models, or in the simplest case, among competing point estimates of a parameter of a model. There are four general steps involved in a likelihood analysis: (1) model specification, (2) parameter estimation using maximum likelihood methods, (3) model comparison, and (4) model evaluation. Our goal in this paper is to review recent developments in the use of likelihood methods and modeling for the analysis of neighborhood processes in forest ecosystems. We will focus on a single class of processes, seed dispersal and seedling dispersion, because recent papers provide compelling evidence of the potential power of the approach, and illustrate some of the statistical challenges in applying the methods.},

The method involves sequentially updating of the parameters of both models within the growth period. Data from 111 plots from the Southwide Seed Source Study of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) were then used to evaluate this iterative approach against the averaging method that assumes a constant tree survival probability and diameter growth rate during the remeasurement interval. Results indicated that the iterative method out-performed the averaging method in predicting future individual tree survival, diameter growth, and stand basal area. The iterative method was superior because it accounted for the variable rate of diameter growth and tree survival probability as functions of ever-changing stand and tree attributes.},

In this study, the loblolly pine - shortleaf pine forest type was divided into three species groups: loblolly pine, other pines, and hardwoods. The growth system includes models for individual tree survival, diameter growth, height growth, and change in crown ratio for each of the three species groups. A multivariate extension of a two-step, model-based interpolation method is proposed to estimate parameters of annual tree growth equations based on measurements from 7-year growth periods. Results based on evaluation statistics such as mean difference, mean absolute difference, and fit index show that the two-step interpolation method is clearly superior to the averaging method, which is a typical linear interpolation method. The two-step method produced growth equations that project tree and plot attributes more accurately than the averaging method. Additionally, a Monte Carlo simulation analysis reveals that parameter estimates obtained from the two-step method are closer to the true parameter values than those from the averaging method. The approach described here should be useful for estimating parameters of other systems of annual tree growth equations from periodic measurements. Models such as the one presented here may be useful for projecting the characteristics of undisturbed forest inventory plots, e.g., FIA plots, and providing more up-to-date inventory estimates.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in actively managing forests to increase their resilience to climate-related changes. Although forest managers rely heavily on the use of silvicultural treatments that manipulate stand structure and stand dynamics to modify responses to climate change, few studies have directly assessed the effects of stand structure or canopy position on climate-growth relationships - or examined how this relationship may vary among species or across environmental gradients. In this study, we analyzed variability in tree-ring series from 15 low-elevation stands in northeastern Washington (USA) using time series analysis and linear mixed effects models. Our objective was to assess the relative influences of species (Pinus ponderosa vs. Pseudotsuga menziesii), crown class (dominant vs. intermediate), and habitat type (Xeric vs. Dry-Mesic) on the climate responses of mature trees in unmanaged forests. We found that climate-growth relationships varied significantly between canopy classes and across habitat types but that these effects were highly species-specific. For P. menziesii, growth responses to temperature and precipitation did not vary between canopy classes. For P. ponderosa, however, regression coefficients for the relationship between temperature and radial growth were nearly twice as large for dominant trees compared to intermediate trees, and 84% of dominant trees were significantly influenced by precipitation, compared to only 62% of intermediate trees. In contrast, habitat-type did not significantly affect the climate responses of P. ponderosa, but did affect responses of P. menziesii. For example, for P. menziesii only 51% of trees in Dry-Mesic sites, were significantly affected by drought (PDSI), compared to 93% in Xeric sites. A better understanding of the relationship between climate sensitivity, species-specific hydraulic strategies, and stand dynamics is crucial for accurately predicting tree responses to climate change and designing forest treatments that will effectively reduce the climatic vulnerability of key forest species and habitats. Results may assist managers with understanding how altering stand dynamics will differentially affect climate-responses of individual species. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Climate forcing is the major abiotic driver for forest ecosystem functioning and thus significantly affects the role of forests within the global carbon cycle and related ecosystem services. Annual radial increments of trees are probably the most valuable source of information to link tree growth and climate at long-term time scales, and have been used in a wide variety of investigations worldwide. However, especially in mountainous areas, tree-ring studies have focused on extreme environments where the climate sensitivity is perhaps greatest but are necessarily a biased representation of the forests within a region. We used tree-ring analyses to study two of the most important tree species growing in the Alps: Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver fir (Abies alba). We developed tree-ring chronologies from 13 mesic mid-elevation sites (203 trees) and then compared them to monthly temperature and precipitation data for the period 1846–1995. Correlation functions, principal component analysis and fuzzy C-means clustering were applied to 1) assess the climate/growth relationships and their stationarity and consistency over time, and 2) extract common modes of variability in the species responses to mean and extreme climate variability. Our results highlight a clear, time-stable, and species-specific response to mean climate conditions. However, during the previous-year's growing season, which shows the strongest correlations, the primary difference between species is in their response to extreme events, not mean conditions. Mesic sites at mid-altitude are commonly underrepresented in tree-ring research; we showed that strong climatic controls of growth may exist even in those areas. Extreme climatic events may play a key role in defining the species-specific responses on climatic sensitivity and, with a global change perspective, specific divergent responses are likely to occur even where current conditions are less limited.},

  abstract = {In a forest stand, competition plays a central role, affecting individual growth. The size-growth relationship (SGR) indicates whether large trees grow proportionally more than (asymmetric SGR), equal to (symmetric), or less than (inversely asymmetric) smaller trees. SGR is thus an indicator of the growth partitioning and competition intensity within a stand. Using tree-ring analysis, we investigated long-term trends and interannual variability of SGR in several Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in the Paneveggio Forest (eastern Italian Alps) over a 100-year period. The study plots were characterized by different stand structures (one multilayered and two monolayered) and disturbance histories (different dates of logging). Logging conducted until the 1940s induced an inversely asymmetric SGR in all the plots. During the successive five decades, in the monolayered plots, it shifted to direct asymmetric (plot 1) and to symmetric (plot 2). In the multilayered plot (plot 3), SGR remained inversely asymmetric. A direct effect of climate on SGR interannual variability was not found. However, fast-growing trees had a stronger climatic signal than slow-growing trees, indicating that growth rate affects tree response to climate. Moreover, we observed that sensitivity to climate was reduced in the monolayered plots over the study period, possibly as a consequence of increased competition.},

  abstract = {Processes governing tree interspecific interactions, such as facilitation and competition, may vary in strength over time. This study tried to unveil them by performing dendrometrical analyses on black spruce Picea mariana, trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and jack pine Pinus banksiana trees from pure and mixed mature boreal forest stands in the Clay Belt of northwestern Quebec and on the tills of northwestern Ontario. We cored 1430 trees and cut 120 for stem analysis across all stand composition types, tree species and study regions. Aspen annual growth rate was initially higher when mixed with conifers, but then progressively decreased over time compared to pure aspen stands, while jack pine growth rate did not differ with black spruce presence throughout all stages of stand development. When mixed with aspen, black spruce showed a contrary response to aspen, i.e. an initial loss in growth but a positive gain later. On the richer clay soil of the Quebec Clay Belt region, however, both aspen and spruce responses in mixed stands reversed between 37 and 54 years. Overall, our results demonstrate that interspecific interactions were present and tended to change with stand development and among species. Our results also suggest that the nature of interspecific interactions may differ with soil nutrient availability.},

A competition-based growth model was developed to simulate stand dynamics and to calculate the yearly growth index series as a ratio between observed and predicted increments. Dendroclimatological analyses were used to evaluate the interactions between intraspecific competition and tree response to climate. For trees living at different competition levels, simple correlation coefficients were calculated between environmental variables (seasonal values of precipitation, temperature, water deficit and surplus) and the growth index series. Results show that beech response to temperature regime and water availability is significantly affected by competition level. When competition is strong, trees are highly sensitivity to water balance; whereas, at a low competition level, trees react positively to high temperatures. Considering that competition may affect tree sensitivity to climate and that thinnings can modify competition regimes it seems possible to influence the climate response of single trees and whole stands through silvicultural treatments and, consequently, to conduct forest management under a hypothesis of climate change. For this purpose, twenty thinning regimes were simulated with a single-tree growth model, varying the treatment intensity and frequency. Four representative regimes were analysed in detail, by examining the predicted yield and the distribution of trees in competition classes, and by evaluating stand sensitivity to climate change.

methods were then applied in various experiments where either environmental factors were monitored (late frosts,
shading, limitation of subsurface resources) or artificial damage on the first growth unit was applied. The number of
growth units established per growth season that make up the seedling axis is reduced by the environmental factors and
by leaf removal. Both growth unit elongation and annual shoot elongation are influenced by environmental factors.
Nevertheless, limitation of subsurface resources reduces elongation, while moderate shading gives better elongation than
full light. This methodology opens up opportunities for joint research addressing the functioning and development of oak

Generally, resources are allocated most efficiently when growth is equally limited by all resources. In the case of carbon and nitrogen, because the carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition and the nitrogen costs of carbon acquisition are high, plants adjust the expenditure of internal reserves to acquire these resources from the environment in approximately constant proportions. If either resource is scarce, reserves of the other are expended in acquiring the first so that both carbon and nitrogen become effectively limiting. Plants also increase the efficiency of resource use in such environments by restricting the rate of resource loss. An understanding of resource balance in plants requires further examination of plant-environment interactions and promises to yield useful insights for managing the trophic dynamics of natural ecosystems.},

variation of budburst (by thermal time to budburst). These ecophysiological traits were analyzed according to the potential
altitudinal limit, which is highly related to frost exposure. Seasonal frost hardiness and PLC changes are relatively
different across species. Maximal PLC observed in winter (PLCMax) was the factor most closely related to potential altitudinal
limit. Moreover, PLCMax was related to the mean hydraulic diameter of vessels (indicating embolism sensitivity) and to osmotic
compounds (indicating ability of living cells to refill xylem conducting elements). Winter embolism formation seems to be
counterbalanced by active refilling from living cells. These results enabled us to model potential altitudinal limit according to
three of the physiological/anatomical parameters studied. Monitoring different frost resistance strategies brings new insights

  abstract = {Changes in forest growth have been found in European forests and worldwide. However most observations have been derived from samples of restricted size, whose representativeness at a regional forest scale is questionable. National forest inventories provide an interesting perspective for both regional scale assessment of these trends and the investigation of their variations over environmental gradients, but have been little used. The aim of our work was to carry out an exploratory modelling analysis of productivity changes, based on the French national forest inventory data. The objectives were: (i) to assess recent trends in forest productivity and to investigate a possible recent decline as found in previous studies; and (ii) to investigate trend variations relative to site fertility factors. We focused on pure and even-aged stands of common beech (Fagus sylvatica L) in north-eastern France, already documented from previous studies based on retrospective data. The dataset consisted of 925 temporary plots inventoried between 1979 and 2007. We developed two regression models of stand basal area increment (BAI) against stand developmental stage (dominant height), site fertility (site index in the SI model, environmental indicators in the El model) and stand density (relative density index). The effect of calendar date was tested in order to investigate possible historical trends. Site fertility-date interactions were also tested to investigate the site-dependence of trends. The fitted models showed a high goodness of fit (adj. R(2) over 0.69). We showed an increase in stand BAI of 27.8% between 1977 and 1987, (10.4% between 1979 and 1987). Stand BAI then decreased by approximately 5% between 1987 and 2004. We thus confirmed the hypothesis of a recent decline in common beech vitality in its temperate range. The chronologies clearly depicted the effect of severe drought events (1976 and 2003), pointing out the predominant role of water availability in the changes observed. No significant site-dependence of the trend was identified. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Competition for light, treefall gap formation and recruitment are the critical phenomena in the genesis of tropical rain forests. These aspects are taken into account to build a new spatially explicit forest growth model called TROLL. Competition for light is modelled by calculating exactly the three-dimensional field of photosynthetically active radiation in the forest understorey. Typically, 10(6) light intensities are computed per hectare at each time step. This light field controls the growth of each tree and establishment/death events. Seed dispersal, dormancy and establishment success as well as a model of treefalls are also included. A special care is paid to the justification and to the validation of each of these modules. The TROLL model is parameterized for a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana using 12 functional groups of species. Using this model the vertical canopy structure and the tree diametric distribution are investigated. The role of treefalls in maintaining pioneer species is also evidenced. A forest succession scenario is simulated and compared to field data. The model is then used to simulate the recolonization of a previously sterilized area by a rain forest plant community. This scenario is interpreted using information available from palaeorecords over the Holocene period and their validity is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be used to study mosaic-like patterns in rain forests, installation of slowly dispersing species, speciation hypotheses and landscape scale dynamics of rain forests.

  abstract = {We used 179 tree ring chronologies of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank to study radial growth response to historical climate variability. For the coastal variety of Douglas-fir, we found positive correlations of ring width with summer precipitation and temperature of the preceding winter, indicating that growth of coastal populations was limited by summer dryness and that photosynthesis in winter contributed to growth. For the interior variety, low precipitation and high growing season temperatures limited growth. Based on these relationships, we chose a simple heat moisture index (growing season temperature divided by precipitation of the preceding winter and current growing season) to predict growth response for the interior variety. For 105 tree ring chronologies or 81% of the interior samples, we found significant linear correlations with this heat moisture index, and moving correlation functions showed that the response was stable over time (1901-1980). We proceeded to use those relationships to predict regional growth response under 18 climate change scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s with unexpected results: for comparable changes in heat moisture index, the most southern and outlying populations of Douglas-fir in Mexico showed the least reduction in productivity. Moderate growth reductions were found in the southern United States, and strongly negative response in the central Rocky Mountains. Growth reductions were further more pronounced for high than for low elevation populations. Based on regional differences in the slope of the growth-climate relationship, we propose that southern populations are better adapted to drought conditions and could therefore contain valuable genotypes for reforestation under climate change. The results support the view that climate change may impact species not just at the trailing edges but throughout their range due to genetic adaptation of populations to local environments.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring studies of long-term growth trends have often produced controversial results. In such studies, the largest-diameter trees in a stand are usually sampled. We assessed the influence of stand dynamics on long-term growth trends by examining the past diameters of all the trees living in two uneven-aged subalpine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in the Italian eastern Alps, as reconstructed from ring widths. The trees were ordered according to diameter, and groups of 12 trees (the 12 largest, the 12 smallest, etc.) were formed. Different diameter groups have different increment curves. In both stands, the 12 largest trees in 1992 have not had consistently faster growth rates than smaller trees. This indicates that changes in diameter ranking order have occurred in the past and may be expected in the future. During stand development, changes occur in the relative position of individual trees, as ordered by diameter. The largest-diameter trees, at any time, may not always have been the largest trees and may not continue to be so. In a given year, the largest trees on average grow slower than other trees, which will become the largest in the future. The mean chronologies of the trees that were among the largest, prior to the harvest, and which presently (in 1992) are no longer in the top 12, and the mean chronologies of the trees that have moved up into the top 12 show very different growth trends. If analysed out of context, they would be interpreted differently, leading to different conclusions on long-term growth trends. when only the 12 largest-diameter trees are sampled, a bias may be present, as the trees may not have been open grown and free of competition in the past. Consequently, studies of long-term growth may be seriously affected by bias attributable to stand dynamics and sampling strategies. In future studies, the growth patterns of all diameter classes in a stand should be assessed, rather than restricting the sampling to the largest diameters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Moreover, it is only logical and rational to require that these models be invariant to changes in the index or base age. This manuscript explains the Generalized Algebraic Difference Approach that can be used effectively to derive truly base-age invariant difference equations capable of describing concurrent polymorphism and variable asymptotes. This new generic methodology for derivation of even the most complex dynamic equations is mathematically sound. The equations derived with it can be extremely flexible and may generate intricate patterns of concurrent polymorphism and variable asymptotes. This methodology is relevant to all situations in which the dependent variable is a function of an unobservable variable, and the models can be implicitly defined by their initial conditions. It is equally useful for derivation of new equations and for improvement of existing base-age specific equations. For. Sci. 46(1):116-126.},

The function of time is the exponential function Y = MTb, and the functions of site are the quadratic function Z = b1 + b2X + b3X(2) and the inverse half-saturation function Z = b1 + b2/(X + b3). We discuss the new dynamic equations based on five exponential substitutions (Richards, Gompertz, Korf, logistic, and log-logistic) and one new logarithmic model substitution in the exponential function of time and 10 special cases of the two functions of site corresponding to their different parameter values. The new dynamic equations presented offer breakthrough flexibility in modeling of the self-referencing dynamics with the exponential and logarithmic functions considered in this article.},

In particular, the extent to which a short-term reduction in gas exchange can be alleviated in the long-term by acclimation processes is not well understood. We studied the impact of a severe reduction in water availability on the water relations and growth of 35-year-old Pinus laricio Poiret. trees in a replicated experiment. Sapwood and needle increments, soil and tree water status, stand transpiration, xylem embolism and plant hydraulic architecture were monitored over a 3-year period in control and drought-treated plots. Needle length was reduced in drought-treated trees by 30, 19 and 29%, and sapwood increments by 50, 27 and 24% over the 3 years. Drought did not result in tree mortality or in extensive xylem embolism or foliage dieback. On the contrary, a conservative water-use strategy was observed, because minimum leaf water potentials did not differ between treatments or over the season. Plant hydraulic resistance was also unaffected by restricted water availability. Stand transpiration was strongly reduced by drought treatment over the summer, but not during the winter, despite significant differences in leaf area between control and drought-treated trees, implying higher transpiration rates per unit leaf area in the droughted plants. This suggests that water transport capacity, rather than the amount of leaf area, controlled stand transpiration, which is at variance with expectations based on experiments with seedlings and short-term experiments with mature trees.},

Comparison, within oak stands from central and eastern parts of France, of frost-cracked and sound trees has established the great variability of sensitivity to frost-crack and the existence of individual predisposing factors (specific gravity, winter moisture content, grain angle, shrinkage, number of rays, early wood vessel cross sectional area and ring width). These methods of characterizing the wood of frost-cracked trees have brought complementary information to all recent research about site and silvicultural predisposing factors. Nevertheless, some anatomical features, supposedly linked with frost-crack occurrence, such as rays, have not been studied in a sufficiently detailed way.},

Hierarchical Bayes (HB) represents a modelling structure with capacity to exploit diverse sources of information, to accommodate influences that are unknown (or unknowable), and to draw inference on large numbers of latent variables and parameters that describe complex relationships. Here I summarize the structure of HB and provide examples for common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all 'unobservables' (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size. Examples demonstrate how different sources of stochasticity impact inference and prediction and how allowance for stochastic influences can guide research.},

  abstract = {Xylem cavitation resistance has profound implications for plant physiology and ecology. This process is characterized by a ‘vulnerability curve’ (VC) showing the variation of the percentage of cavitation as a function of xylem pressure potential. The shape of this VC varies from ‘sigmoidal’ to ‘exponential’. This review provides a panorama of the techniques that have been used to generate such a curve. The techniques differ by (i) the way cavitation is induced (e.g. bench dehydration, centrifugation, or air injection), and (ii) the way cavitation is measured (e.g. percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) or acoustic emission), and a nomenclature is proposed based on these two methods. A survey of the literature of more than 1200 VCs was used to draw statistics on the usage of these methods and on their reliability and validity. Four methods accounted for more than 96% of all curves produced so far: bench dehydration–PLC, centrifugation–PLC, pressure sleeve-PLC, and Cavitron. How the shape of VCs varies across techniques and species xylem anatomy was also analysed. Strikingly, it was found that the vast majority of curves obtained with the reference bench dehydration-PLC method are ‘sigmoidal’. ‘Exponential’ curves were more typical of the three other methods and were remarkably frequent for species having large xylem conduits (ring-porous), leading to a substantial overestimation of the vulnerability of cavitation for this functional group. We suspect that ‘exponential’ curves may reflect an open-vessel artefact and call for more precautions with the usage of the pressure sleeve and centrifugation techniques.},

  abstract = {he water relations of 30-year-old Quercus petraea were studied for three consecutive growing seasons. Whole tree specific hydraulic conductances (gL) were computed from sap flow densities (dF)/leaf water potential (Ψleaf) relationships. gL was clearly reduced with the development of the drought. The decrease of gL with Ψpredawn was of an exponential type, ie, high variations of gL were found whereas Ψpredawn remained high and constant. These early variations of gL were most probably located in the soil-root compartment of the SPAC because no loss of hydraulic conductivity due to xylem embolism was detected in the crown of the trees. Although gL was reduced, Ψmidday remained nearly constant and above -3 MPa throughout the drought period because dFmidday was also significantly reduced. As a consequence, a good linear relation was found between dFmidday and gL. Xylem embolism significantly developed in the petioles and twigs of Q petraea when Ψmidday became less than - 3 MPa. We argue that, because of changes in gL, Q petraea progressively adjusted its water loss throughout the drought development with the effect of maintaining Ψmidday above the cavitation threshold. It is shown that if no water loss regulation had occurred, considerable tensions would have developed in the crown of these trees with predictable branch mortality due to runaway embolism.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims There is considerable evidence for the presence of positive species diversity–productivity relationships in plant populations, but the population parameters determining the type and strength of the relationship are poorly defined. Relationships between species evenness and tree survival or species coexistence are not well established. The objective of this study was to quantify the joint effects of density and species evenness on tree productivity and species coexistence.Methods A 12-year-old experimental tree plantation mixing two species according to a double gradient of density and species proportion was used. A neighbourhood approach was employed and descriptors of local competition were used to model individual tree growth. Fagus sylvatica and Acer pseudoplatanus were used as model species, as they can be considered as ecologically equivalent in their young stages.Key Results Density and tree size were primary factors determining individual growth and stand productivity. Species identity had a significant, but less pronounced, role. Stand productivity was highest when species evenness was close to 1 and slightly lower in uneven mixtures. The reduction in stand productivity when species evenness decreased was of similar magnitude irrespective of which species became dominant, indicating symmetric effects for the two species. When examining individual tree growth in response to species proportion for each species separately, it was observed for both species that individual trees exhibited greater growth in uneven mixtures in which the other species was more frequent.Conclusions The results suggest that mixtures of these two functionally similar species have the highest production at maximum evenness, indicating a complementary effect between them. The presence of a mixture combines both stabilizing mechanisms (individuals from both species show higher growth when surrounded by individuals from the other species) and equalizing mechanisms (the two species have very similar growth curves) that, in turn, determine the species' relative dominance. These processes should act to ensure the long-term coexistence of species.},

Despite this, little is known about the impact fire regimes have on this resource, or the role topography may play in preserving hollows through the mitigation of fire intensity. This study examined the effect different combinations of fire frequency and topography have on (i) the number of hollow bearing logs and (ii) the presence and size of hollows within logs. The influence of wildfire severity and logging were also examined. Hollow availability (i.e. density of hollow bearing logs and hollow presence within logs) was greatest at sites burnt at ‘low’ frequency. The density of hollow logs was greater in gullies, though the effect of fire frequency did not vary with topographic position. Hollows showing signs of internal fire charring typically had a greater entrance width than unburnt hollows, which suggests fire plays an important role in creating large hollows. The number of hollow bearing logs increased with logging intensity, due to unmerchantable timber being left in situ. Wildfire severity had little effect on log hollows. The results indicate that frequent burning may reduce hollow availability, though it is likely that gullies will still retain a high density of hollow bearing logs irrespective of burning, and may play an important role in preserving connectivity of this resource across landscapes.},

  abstract = {Philosophy of ecology has been slow to become established as an area of philosophical interest, but it is now receiving considerable attention. This area holds great promise for the advancement of both ecology and the philosophy of science. Insights from the philosophy of science can advance ecology in a number of ways. For example, philosophy can assist with the development of improved models of ecological hypothesis testing and theory choice. Philosophy can also help ecologists understand the role and limitations of mathematical models in ecology. On the other side, philosophy of science will be advanced by having ecological case studies as part of the stock of examples. Ecological case studies can shed light on old philosophical topics as well as raise novel issues for the philosophy of science. For example, understanding theoretical terms such as "biodiversity" is important for scientific reasons, but such terms also carry political importance. Formulating appropriate definitions for such terms is thus not a purely scientific matter, and this may prompt a reevaluation of philosophical accounts of defining theoretical terms. We consider some of the topics currently receiving attention in the philosophy of ecology and other topics in need of attention. Our aim is to prompt further exchange between ecology and philosophy of science and to help set the agenda for future work in the philosophy of ecology. The topics covered include: the role of mathematical models, environmental problem formulation, biodiversity, and environmental ethics.},

Franco) using data collected in stands in Great Britain (GB) and Western Canada. These two conifers are native to Western North America and have been widely planted in GB. Results indicate differences between stands in Canada and GB in both the intercept and slope of the log maximum density–log size boundary lines. In GB, the slope (b) of the relationship between log of stand density (number of trees per hectare) and log of quadratic mean diameter (Dq) is steeper than the theoretical value of −1.605 (−2.063 for Sitka spruce and −1.864 for Douglas-fir). Values of b are lower in Canada (−1.437 for Sitka spruce and −1.241 for Douglas-fir) than in GB. Within each region, b is similar for the two species. However, the intercept term differs for Sitka spruce and Douglas-fir in GB. These differences provide additional evidence that density–size boundary line relationships are influenced by environmental and other factors and indicate the need for development of density–size relationships for each species and for each region where the species is grown. Maximum stand density index (SDI) values calculated using these relationships are 1868 and 2073 for Sitka spruce and 1491 and 1815 for Douglas-fir in GB and Canada, respectively. Differences in maximum SDI between these two regions may be related to differences in climate, provenance, stand history and other factors. Maximum density–size relationships presented in this paper can be used as a starting point for managing stand density for both even-aged and continuous cover stands and for identifying potential maximum stocking in stands of these species in GB and Canada.},

  abstract = {Light is widely considered to be the most important factor limiting the performance of plants on the floors of forests and woodlands, but the roles of nutrient availability and water supply remain poorly defined. We seek to predict the types of forest in which root competition affects seedling performance, and the types of plants that respond most strongly to release from root competition. We then test our predictions by reviewing experiments in which tree seedlings and forest herbs are released from belowground competition, usually by cutting trenches to sever the roots of surrounding trees. First, we provide a worldwide review of changes in canopy form and fine-root mass along gradients of soil fertility and seasonal drought, keeping in mind the stages of forest development. Our review shows that penetration of light is least in forests on moist soils providing large amounts of major nutrients. The changes are far more complex than those considered by allocation models. Dry woodlands typically allow 20 times as much light to penetrate as do wet forests, but there is surprisingly little evidence that they have greater fine-root densities in the topsoil. Tropical rain forests on highly infertile soils have only slightly more open canopies than those on fertile soils, but much greater fine-root densities. Northern temperate forests on highly acidic peats and sandy soils are often dominated by early-successional, open-canopied conifers (generally pines), mostly as a result of recurrent fires, and transmit about five times as much light as surrounding deciduous forests. A review of trenching experiments shows that light alone limits seedling growth in forests on moist, nutrient-rich soils, but competition for belowground resources becomes important on infertile soils and in drier regions. Secondly, we consider how root competition alters species' shade tolerances. Shade-house experiments demonstrate that species differ markedly in the minimum irradiance at which they respond to nutrient addition, but there generally tends to be a sizable response at >5% daylight and little response in <2% daylight. There is some evidence that species that have high potential growth rates and that respond markedly to increased irradiance are also most responsive to nutrient addition in 2-3% daylight. T Smith and M. Huston have hypothesized that species cannot tolerate both shade and drought; this appears to be the case for species that tolerate shade chiefly by maximizing leaf area. However, many shade-tolerant woody plants in tropical and mediterranean-climate forests have thick, tough, long-lived leaves and a relatively high allocation to roots, and these species are much more drought tolerant. A few studies indicate that root trenching allows species to persist in deeper shade than that in which they are normally found and allows species from mesic sites to invade more xeric sites. Usually, the impact of trenching on growth rate is much greater in gaps than in the understory. Finally, we discuss the ways in which life-form composition and population structure of plant communities are shaped by reduced water: supply and reduced nutrient availability, emphasizing the inadequacy of models that consider the impact of "belowground resource availability" in a generic sense. Competition in a dry climate leads to widely spaced dominants, a lack of interstitial plants, high rates of seedling mortality in the understory, and a restriction of regeneration to patches where established matrix-forming plants have died. In contrast, vegetation on moist, infertile sites is characterized by closely packed, slender dominants, miniaturized interstitial plants, and slow rates of seedling growth in the understory, combined with relatively low rates of seedling mortality. Consequently, there is a continuum of sizes among the individuals of the dominant species, and a lack of reliance on gaps for establishment.},

  abstract = {Predicted climate change is expected to significantly affect tree growth in many areas. We used a process-based model (Physiological Principles for Predicting Growth, 3-PG) to evaluate how climatic variation might alter growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) across biogeoclimatic zones in British Columbia. The results indicate that there will be significant changes in site index (defined as the height (in metres) of dominant trees at 50 years) over this century. In the interior, a reduction in site index is likely, particularly in stands with mid-range values of site index (25-30 m), with many of the interior bio-ecoclimatic zones predicted to experience a gradual mean decrease in site index by up to 10%. Individual sites may decrease by as much as 40% from current values. In contrast, site index along the coast overall is predicted to increase to a maximum of 43 m by 2080. In the Coastal Western Hemlock zone, however, mean site index is likely to increase from 26 m to only 34 m. We believe that combining process-based models with fine-spatial resolution climate forecasts offers a viable approach to assess future changes in forest productivity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Competition is known to be a key driver of plant population dynamics. However, understanding how different types of competitive processes interact with population structure in driving population dynamics remains challenging. Ecologists broadly distinguish between two types of competition: size-asymmetric competition (SAC), related to resource pre-emption, and size-symmetric competition (SSC), related to resource depletion. SAC and SSC are known to influence plant-size population structures differently. Usually, SAC increases size inequality and, in return, changes in size inequality reinforce the role of SAC. On the contrary, SSC generally triggers size structure homogeneity. Although numerous simulations and experimental studies have explored how SAC influences population size structure, there is still no clear way to estimate the reverse effect: how changes in the size structure of a population affects the role of SAC compared to SSC in plant growth. In this article, we propose a modelling approach to estimate how size structure influences the role SAC plays in growth in mono-specific forest stands. First, we show that the role of SAC can be assessed by an equation that involves the Gini index, a well-known size inequality index. We then apply our approach to national forest inventory data in France, focusing on two major species: European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). This article discusses the conditions necessary to apply such a modelling approach and gives perspectives for further development in plant ecology.},

  abstract = {The empirical growth and yield (G&Y) curves used in most timber supply models assume that growth conditions are invariable over time, which may not be correct given the projected future climate. However, errors in G&Y models can be quite large, and we therefore wanted to know the probability of detecting climate change-induced growth anomalies as a departure from current G&Y predictions. The work was carried out in a boreal forest study area in Eastern Canada, where Picea mariana Mill. BSP (black spruce) is the dominant species. Climate change effects were incorporated into G&Y predictions as correction factors obtained from process-based simulations of growth using current or projected climate. Uncertainty in G&Y projections was quantified through the inclusion of sampling and model errors in a bootstrap re-sampling scheme that yielded a percentile distribution of possible differences between G&Y curves that included or did not include climate change effects. Results yielded an average projected increase in productivity of 29% under future climate conditions for the black spruce strata in the study area. The probability of the climate change-modified G&Y predictions being significantly different from the current G&Y projections is 75% when considering the sampling error alone, and of 67% when both the sampling and modelling errors are included. Although incomplete in terms of what sources of error have been included, this study demonstrates the type of information that can be generated on the propagation of uncertainty in G&Y projections and, ultimately, on timber supply.

  abstract = {Background and Aims Despite general agreement regarding the adaptive importance of plasticity, evidence for the role of environmental resource availability in plants is scarce. In arid and semi-arid environments, the persistence and dominance of perennial species depends on their capacity to tolerate drought: tolerance could be given on one extreme by fixed traits and, on the other, by plastic traits. To understand drought tolerance of species it is necessary to know the plasticity of their water economy-related traits, i.e. the position in the fixed–plastic continuum.Methods Three conspicuous co-existing perennial grasses from a Patagonian steppe were grown under controlled conditions with four levels of steady-state water availability. Evaluated traits were divided into two groups. The first was associated with potential plant performance and correlated with fitness, and included above-ground biomass, total biomass, tillering and tiller density at harvest. The second group consisted of traits associated with mechanisms of plant adjustment to environmental changes and included root biomass, shoot/root ratio, tiller biomass, length of total elongated leaf, length of yellow tissue divided by time and ﬁnal length divided by the time taken to reach ﬁnal length.Key Results and Conclusions The most plastic species along this drought gradient was the most sensitive to drought, whereas the least plastic and slowest growing was the most tolerant. This negative relationship between tolerance and plasticity was true for fitness-related traits but was trait-dependent for underlying traits. Remarkably, the most tolerant species had the highest positive plasticity (i.e. opposite to the default response to stress) in an underlying trait, directly explaining its drought resistance: it increased absolute root biomass. The niche differentiation axis that allows the coexistence of species in this group of perennial dryland grasses, all limited by soil surface moisture, would be a functional one of fixed versus plastic responses.},

Increased stem production has been attributed to shifts in growth from roots to shoot, and such shifts would have important implications for belowground carbon sequestration. We examined above and belowground growth and biomass accumulation and distribution in two eastern cottonwood clones and American sycamore receiving irrigation (I), fertilization (F), or irrigation + fertilization (IF) and compared with non-treated controls (C). Aboveground growth and biomass accumulation responded positively to both I and F in all genotypes. After three growing seasons, the largest trees were sycamore receiving the IF treatment, with a total mean annual biomass production of 9.4 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Total cottonwood mean annual biomass production in both clones was &gt;5.0 Mg ha−1 yr−1 in the IF treatment. Aboveground biomass production was 6.3 and &gt;3.1 Mg ha−1 yr−1 for sycamore and cottonwoods, respectively. Total root mass fraction was lower in high resource treatments and declined as stands aged. To compare allocation in trees of equal size, we used allometric relationships between above and belowground tissue. Allometric relationships between woody perennial tissues rarely differed among treatments. Improved resource availability caused large increases in growth and consequently accelerated development, but it had little effect on belowground allocation that was not explained by development. Reports of shifting belowground allocation due to soil resource availability must account for developmental effects if they are to accurately evaluate direct impacts of soil resources.},

The individual-tree growth model was based on annual basal area growth, height growth and survival probability. The model included variables from groups pertaining to tree size, competition and age. Weighted regression was used as a tool for dealing with missing height observations in model fitting. Evaluation of the model via simulation of growth and mortality in the period between inventories showed that the variable growth rate approach provided slightly better results than the constant growth rate approach. The final model was consistent with expected diameter growth, height growth, dominant height growth, stand basal area growth and reduction in number of stems per hectare. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be con. dent in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples ( both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quanti. able uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

  abstract = {The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is a distance-independent, individual-tree forest growth model widely used in the United States to support management decisionmaking. Stands are the basic projection unit, but the spatial scope can be many thousands of stands. The temporal scope is several hundred years at a resolution of 5–10 years. Projections start with a summary of current conditions evident in the input inventory data. FVS contains a self-calibration feature that uses measured growth rates to modify predictions for local conditions. Component models predict the growth and mortality of individual trees, and extensions to the base model represent disturbance agents including insects, pathogens, and fire. The component models differ depending on the geographic region represented by regionally specific model variants. The differences are due to data availability and the applicability of existing models. The model supports specification of management rules in the input, such as thinning if density is too high. The rules can be extended to represent other factors. For example, the effect of climate change on stand development by entering rules that specify how growth and mortality will change in response to changing climate. Applications range from development of silvicultural prescription for single stands to landscape and large regional assessments. Key issues addressed with FVS include forest development, wildlife habitat, pest outbreaks, and fuels management. The predictions are used to gain insights into how forested environments will respond to alternative management actions. Broad-scale forest management policies have been studied with FVS. For the 30 years since the model was initially introduced, the development team has anticipated and provided needed enhancements and maintained a commitment to working with and training users. The existence of an adequate user interface and the continued use of the original programming language are often overlooked factors for the success of this model. Future work will focus on improving FVS by adopting recent biometric techniques and including new information linking geomorphology to mortality and growth. Extending the model to more closely represent biophysical processes and adapting the model so that it is more relevant to management questions related to predicted climate change are also foci. Providing ways to dynamically link FVS to other models is our current strategy for providing major new capabilities.},

This review encompasses the main concepts and results concerning the hydraulic of architecture of trees. After a short paragraph about the definition of the h.a., the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the h.a. are presented. This is an occasion to discuss the pipe model from the h.a. point of view. The second part starts with the central concept of embolism and give a review of important experimental results and questions concerning summer and winter embolism. The last part deals with the coupling between hydraulic and stomatal conductances. It discusses the theoretical and experimental relationships between transpiration and leaf water potential during a progressive soil drought, the increase of soil-root resistance and its consequences in term of xylem vulnerability, the factors controlling the daily maximum transpiration and how stomates can prevent "run away embolism". In conclusion different kinds of unsolved questions of h.a., which can be a matter of future investigations, are presented in addition with a classification of trees behaviour under drought conditions. To end, an appendix recalls the notions of water potential, pressure and tension. 

Résumé 
Architecture hydraulique des arbres : concepts principaux et résultats. Sans aucun doute, depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'architecture hydraulique (a.h.) est devenue une approche majeure dans le domaine des relations plantes-eau (et particulièrement pour les arbres). Cette revue présente les principaux concepts et résultats concernant l'a.h. Après un bref paragraphe sur la définition de l'a.h., les caractéristiques qualitatives et quantitatives définissant l'a.h. sont passées en revue. À cette occasion le " pipe model " est discuté du point de vue de l'a.h. La seconde partie commence avec le concept central d'embolie et continue avec une présentation des principaux résultats et questions touchant l'embolie estivale et l'embolie hivernale. La dernière partie analyse le " couplage " entre les conductances hydraulique et stomatique. Il y est discuté des relations théoriques et expérimentales entre la transpiration et le potentiel hydrique foliaire durant la mise en place d'une sécheresse progressive du sol, de l'augmentation de la résistance sol-racines et de ses conséquences en terme de vulnérabilité du xylème, des facteurs contrôlant la transpiration maximale journalière et de quelle manière les stomates peuvent prévenir l'emballement de l'embolie. La conclusion fait éétat de différentes questions non résolues, qui pourraient faire l'objet de recherches futures et esquisse une classification du comportement des arbres vis-à-vis de la sécheresse. Pour finir, un appendice rappelle les notions de potentiel hydrique, de pression et de tension.},

  abstract = {The intra-annual dynamics of wood formation, which involves the passage of newly produced cells through three successive differentiation phases (division, enlargement, and wall thickening) to reach the final functional mature state, has traditionally been described in conifers as three delayed bell-shaped curves followed by an S-shaped curve. Here the classical view represented by the ‘Gompertz function (GF) approach’ was challenged using two novel approaches based on parametric generalized linear models (GLMs) and ‘data-driven’ generalized additive models (GAMs). These three approaches (GFs, GLMs, and GAMs) were used to describe seasonal changes in cell numbers in each of the xylem differentiation phases and to calculate the timing of cell development in three conifer species [Picea abies (L.), Pinus sylvestris L., and Abies alba Mill.]. GAMs outperformed GFs and GLMs in describing intra-annual wood formation dynamics, showing two left-skewed bell-shaped curves for division and enlargement, and a right-skewed bimodal curve for thickening. Cell residence times progressively decreased through the season for enlargement, whilst increasing late but rapidly for thickening. These patterns match changes in cell anatomical features within a tree ring, which allows the separation of earlywood and latewood into two distinct cell populations. A novel statistical approach is presented which renews our understanding of xylogenesis, a dynamic biological process in which the rate of cell production interplays with cell residence times in each developmental phase to create complex seasonal patterns.},

Intra-annual dynamics of wood formation, shoot elongation and needle phenology were monitored over 3 years in five Norway spruces (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), five Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and five silver firs (Abies alba Mill.) grown intermixed. For the three species, the growing season (delimited by cambial activity onset and cessation) lasted about 4 months, while the whole process of wood formation lasted 5–6 months. Needle unfolding and shoot elongation followed the onset of cambial activity and lasted only one-third of the season. Pines exhibited an ‘extensive strategy’ of cambial activity, with long durations but low growth rates, while firs and spruces adopted an ‘intensive strategy’ with shorter durations but higher growth rates. We estimated that about 75% of the annual radial increment variability was attributable to the rate of cell production, and only 25% to its duration. Cambial activity rates culminated at the same time for the three species, whereas shoot elongation reached its maximal rate earlier in pines. Results show that species-specific life strategies are recognizable through functional traits of intra-annual growth dynamics. The opposition between Scots pine extensive strategy and silver fir and Norway spruce intensive strategy supports the theory that pioneer species are greater resource expenders and develop riskier life strategies to capture resources, while shade-tolerant species utilize resources more efficiently and develop safer life strategies. Despite different strategies, synchronicity of the maximal rates of cambial activity suggests a strong functional convergence between co-existing conifer species, resulting in head-on competition for resources.},

  abstract = {The ability to withstand disturbance (resistance) and the ability to recover biomass following disturbance (resilience) were investigated in Australian wet tropical rainforest tree species. These two attributes are expected to be negatively correlated, because investment of biomass in structural support (conferring resistance) results in trees exhibiting high wood densities and slow growth rates, and vice versa. We examined species' responses to disturbance caused by a severe tropical cyclone to test this hypothesized trade-off. We assessed cyclone damage in six species in three Mabi rainforest fragments on the Atherton Tablelands. Species differed in the proportion of individuals within four damage categories (minor damage, severe branch damage, snapped, uprooted). Resistance was positively related to wood density. We found a positive correlation between the proportion of trees experiencing minor damage only and wood density, supporting the hypothesized association between resistance and mechanical strength. Among the subset of trees in which stems snapped, rates of resprouting differed between species and were highest in low wood density species and lowest in species with highest wood density. Resilience, characterized as the ability to recover biomass following disturbance and estimated as growth rate standardized for stem diameter at breast height (g day(-1) . mm(-1)), was negatively related to wood density. Thus, species with low wood densities were more likely to suffer stem and branch damage owing to cyclonic winds, but also demonstrated highest resprouting and fastest responses in terms of redeveloping biomass in the 8 months following disturbance. This suggests that a species' position along the resistance-resilience spectrum can be predicted by mean wood density, which may allow managers to predict species' responses to future cyclones. Our findings also provide mechanistic evidence for the 'direct regeneration' model of post-cyclone succession, where response is characterized by resprouting and species composition is unchanged.},

In order to clarify its auto-ecological Limits, and to provide forest managers with relevant information for planting, we studied its productivity in a wide range of site conditions. Based on data from 202 Douglas-Fir pure stands at mid-elevation regions, site productivity was assessed using variance analysis with site types, site groups, and multiple regression analysis with ecological variables. Site index, determined from stem analysis data, was used as a species specific measure of site quality. Results show that Douglas-Fir site index is correlated to soil nutrient status, and secondarily to soil moisture regime. Mean stand productivity was generally high, but considerable variation in site index was determined within a study area that was classified by forest managers as uniform. Correlation between site classification and site index was confirmed, because it was based on synoptic factors that are simple and robust indicators of site productivity. Other methods to assess site quality, such as multiple regression on ecological variables and multivariate site groups, appear to be less explicative and robust for predicting site index. The results allow forest managers to predict the site index at parcel scale. Further investigation should be carried out in order to explain the major causes of the unexplained variance of site index by ecological variables, especially genetic variation, and effect of age.

Trees of similar dbh or total height were currently quite similar in crown dimensions, although they had arrived at this condition by somewhat different routes. Striking differences among spacings in apparent site indices are attributed mainly to restriction of height growth by competition rather than to real site differences. Average heights of several stand components were compared as bases for site index estimates; heights of a fixed number of the largest diameter trees were most nearly consistent among spacings, although no procedure eliminated spacing effects. Comparisons suggest possible usefulness of live-crown length as one criterion for acceptable site trees in stands of abnormal density. High initial density in low-site stands can lead to serious underestimates of potential productivity. Forest Sci. 16:287-301.},

Here we identify a temperature threshold for decline in a tree ring record from a well-established temperature-sensitive site at elevational tree line in northwestern Canada. The positive ring width/temperature relationship has weakened such that a pre-1965 linear model systematically overpredicts tree ring widths from 1965 to 1999. A nonlinear model shows an inverted U-shaped relationship between this chronology and summer temperatures, with an optimal July-August average temperature of 11.3degreesC based on a nearby station. This optimal value has been consistently exceeded since the 1960s, and the concurrent decline demonstrates that even at tree line, trees can be negatively affected when temperatures warm beyond a physiological threshold. If warming continues without significant gains in effective precipitation, the large-scale greening of recent decades could be replaced by large-scale browning.

  abstract = {An anomalous reduction in forest growth indices and temperature sensitivity has been detected in tree-ring width and density records from many circumpolar northern latitude sites since around the middle 20th century. This phenomenon, also known as the "divergence problem", is expressed as an offset between warmer instrumental temperatures and their underestimation in reconstruction models based on tree rings. The divergence problem has potentially significant implications for large-scale patterns of forest growth, the development of paleoclimatic reconstructions based on tree-ring records from northern forests, and the global carbon cycle. Herein we review the current literature published on the divergence problem to date, and assess its possible causes and implications. The causes, however, are not well understood and are difficult to test due to the existence of a number of covarying environmental factors that may potentially impact recent tree growth. These possible causes include temperature-induced drought stress, nonlinear thresholds or time-dependent responses to recent warming, delayed snowmelt and related changes in seasonality, and differential growth/climate relationships inferred for maximum, minimum and mean temperatures. Another possible cause of the divergence described briefly herein is 'global dimming', a phenomenon that has appeared, in recent decades, to decrease the amount of solar radiation available for photosynthesis and plant growth on a large scale. It is theorized that the dimming phenomenon should have a relatively greater impact on tree growth at higher northern latitudes, consistent with what has been observed from the tree-ring record. Additional potential causes include "end effects" and other methodological issues that can emerge in standardization and chronology development, and biases in instrumental target data and its modeling. Although limited evidence suggests that the divergence may be anthropogenic in nature and restricted to the recent decades of the 20th century, more research is needed to confirm these observations.

  abstract = {Competition is a well-documented contributor to tree mortality in temperate forests, with numerous studies documenting a relationship between tree death and the competitive environment. Models frequently rely on competition as the only non-random mechanism affecting tree mortality. However, for mature forests, competition may cease to be the primary driver of mortality. We use a large, long-term dataset to study the importance of competition in determining tree mortality in old-growth forests on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada of California, U.S.A. We make use of the comparative spatial configuration of dead and live trees, changes in tree spatial pattern through time, and field assessments of contributors to an individual tree's death to quantify competitive effects. Competition was apparently a significant contributor to tree mortality in these forests. Trees that died tended to be in more competitive environments than trees that survived, and suppression frequently appeared as a factor contributing to mortality. On the other hand, based on spatial pattern analyses, only three of 14 plots demonstrated compelling evidence that competition was dominating mortality. Most of the rest of the plots fell within the expectation for random mortality, and three fit neither the random nor the competition model. These results suggest that while competition is often playing a significant role in tree mortality processes in these forests it only infrequently governs those processes. In addition, the field assessments indicated a substantial presence of biotic mortality agents in trees that died. While competition is almost certainly important, demographics in these forests cannot accurately be characterized without a better grasp of other mortality processes. In particular, we likely need a better understanding of biotic agents and their interactions with one another and with competition.},

  abstract = {A model simulating forest carbon and water fluxes was improved to simulate carbon allocation to roots, reserves and aboveground woody biomass and to estimate maximum leaf area index of the current year (LAImax). LAImax was calculated from the carbohydrates reserve, which integrates past ecological conditions. Allocation coefficients to the various compartments were originally fixed constant in the basic version, with no temporal and spatial variation. In the improved version, these coefficients were modified spatially and temporally according to functional rules. Carbon allocation to fine roots was simulated by accounting for hydraulic constraints. An empirical model was developed to simulate allocation to reserves. Allocation to aboveground woody biomass was the residual; remaining carbon after allocation to reserves and fine roots. Then, this residual carbon was partitioned into stem diameter and height growth. The allocation model was tested on 20 stands of oak and beech in the Fontainebleau forest. The model reproduced wood growth and LAImax dynamics between 1994 and 1999. While the basic version of the model overestimated the growth (364 gC m−2 year−1 vs. 261 gC m−2 year−1) and did not reproduced the growth variability well between sites (r = 0.4), the new version better reproduced the average level of growth (235 gC m−2 year−1 vs. 261 gC m−2 year−1) and the variability (r = 0.64). That model also reproduced the decline of productivity with age and the processes leading to temporal variability in LAI, such as water stress in the previous year.},

While many studies have focused on average LAI, we estimated clumping and measured both average LAI and the variation around it. LAI was derived from digital hemispherical photos at three sites: an unmanaged Fagus sylvatica forest in temperate area (control site), a mixed Mediterranean forest of Quercus ilex and Pinus halepensis, and regeneration of F. sylvatica under a mature stand of Pinus nigra in mountainous area. LAI measurements were also made with LAI 2000 devices over 5 years (from 1994 to 1998) within forest stands dominated by either beech (F. sylvatica L.), by oaks (Quercus petraea (Matus) Liebl., Quercus robur (Matus) Liebl.), or by Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Thinning led to a variable decrease in LAI. The coefficient of variation of LAI (CVLAI) provided a useful ecological index of the level and type of thinning. For undisturbed stands, CVLAI varied from 10% to 20%, corresponding to the higher average LAI values. Disturbances created by thinning increase LAI spatial variability, resulting in larger CVLAI values for all stands considered. Possible explanations of these results and use in remote sensing were discussed.},

  abstract = {Theoretical and empirical studies have long suggested that stability and complexity are intimately related, but evidence from long-lived systems at large scales is lacking. Stability can either be driven by complex species interactions, or it can be driven by the presence/absence and abundance of a species best able to perform a specific ecosystem function. We use 64 years of stand productivity measures in forest systems composed of four dominant conifer tree species to contrast the effect of species richness and abundance on three stability measures. To perform this contrast, we measured the annual growth increments of > 900 trees in mixed and pure forest stands to test three hypotheses: increased species richness will (1) decrease stand variance, (2) increase stand resistance to drought events, and (3) increase stand resilience to drought events. In each case, the alternate hypothesis was that species richness had no effect, but that species composition and abundance within a stand drove variance, resistance, and resilience. In pure stands, the four species demonstrated significant differences in productivity, and in their resistance and resilience to drought events. The two pine species were the most drought resistant and resilient, whereas mountain hemlock was the least resistant and resilient, and red fir was intermediate. For community measures we found a moderately significant (P = 0.08) increase in the community coefficient of variation and a significant (P = 0.03) increase in resilience with increased species richness, but no significant relationship between species richness and community resistance, though the variance in community resistance to drought decreased with species richness. Community resistance to drought was significantly (P = 0.001) correlated to the relative abundance of lodgepole pine, the most resistant species. We propose that resistance is driven by competition for a single limiting resource, with negative diversity effects. In contrast resilience measures the capacity of communities to partition resources in the absence of a single limiting resource, demonstrating positive diversity effects.},

  abstract = {Functional processes in trees undergo changes as the tree size increases, which may affect the response of trees to environmental factors. We tested tree-ring response to climate in four groups of trees, including large and small Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinea trees using cluster, principal component (PC) and dendroclimatological analysis. The trees were of the same age and growing on a plantation in the semiarid coastal area of southern Spain. Cluster and PC analyses showed a clear separation into four groups of trees. Autocorrelation and mean sensitivity showed significant differences between the two size classes. PCA recognised four representative principal components where PC1 represented the tree-ring-climate variability common to both species and sizes, whereas PC2, PC3 and PC4 represented a species-specific and size-dependent response of trees to climate. The differences between the two size classes were greater than those between the two species. The results suggest that future tree-ring studies should include trees stratified by size. Only this would make it possible to produce unbiased predictions on the consequences of climate change and to devise suitable mitigation strategies for preserving Mediterranean forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In order to describe the productivity of pure even-aged stands of common beech, a system of three differential equations is proposed for dominant height, basal area and total volume growth. The model was derived and fitted to 317 observation periods in 29 long-term experimental plots ranging from northwest to northeast France. It involves parameters at the forest and stand levels. Site index is the asymptote of the height-age curve. Model structure is such that, for any given height, some differences in total volume yield exist between stands of different productivities. This result is in contradiction with Eichhorn's rule. However, in our model, no parameter other than site index is necessary to characterize stand productivity. The possibility to generalize the model to a larger range of ecological conditions is discussed by a process-based interpretation. The site dependence of the parameters can be understood by reference to carbon-balance models. A linear relationship between basal area and height-growth rates is investigated by a separate model of sapwood geometry and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Even-aged single-species stands of beech ( Fagus sylvatica) or sessile oak ( Quercus petraea) in France are frequently in conflict from the standpoint of dynamics (stand growth rate), the factors that determine wood quality (the effect of fast/slow growth regimes) and the effect of thinning (the capability of remaining trees to benefit from thinning operations). The author deals with the last point by analysing the competition between social ranks of trees, in particular, how thinning regulates competition, and what its effect is on differential growth of tree social classes. The more localized aspects of competition (the stimulating effect of localized thinning, or trimming, for the benefit of final crop trees) are not considered. The analysis was performed on networks of permanent plots established between 1880 and 1935. The analyses showed up features in common between the two species studied, that are appropriately referred to as 'social' features: both tree species form highly structured systems in which individuals which rank highest socially are those that grow the fastest. A simplified model is used to more accurately quantify the relationship between social rank and growth rate. However, there were notable differences between the two species also: for beech, surplus growth afforded by thinning was all the more pronounced the higher the tree's initial status was. For oak, the benefits of thinning were uniform whatever the trees' social status, at least in terms of basal area. These differences in growth behaviour and response to thinning are discussed with reference to competition for light and soil resources, particularly water.},

The advantages and drawbacks of each method are compared, in the light of studies on the effect of environmental changes (CO 2, nitrogen inputs, climate) on French forest dynamics. The first accurate diagnoses at stand level are beginning to be available, and indicate that today's stand productivity is 50% higher than at the beginning of this century. Major research areas now are: (1) to generalize the observations to other species and regions, especially at the stand-level; (2) to evaluate the concomitant changes in wood quality; (3) to better understand the role of environmental changes; and (4) to evaluate the associated ecological risks. In any case, we believe that forest managers should take this accelerated growth into consideration (shorter rotations, increased wood supply, intensified regeneration, forest contribution to policies to mitigate greenhouse effects, etc.).},

These forests spread along a climatic gradient, from the atlantic sites (Normandie) to the more continental sites (Lorraine). In each forest, 10 plots have been observed, in stands of various ages, and submitted to different silvicultures. We analysed dominant height and stand basal area increments. The modeling of height-age curves revealed different curve shapes between forests. In 2 forests out of 4, the residuals exhibit a very strong structure with date: growth rate has steadily increased since the 1930s. Basal area increment was modelled with much more details, taking into account the effects of age, stand density, periodic fluctuations and different growth levels between plots. These effects are combined with a smooth trend function of date, the amplitude of which was fitted on a per forest basis. Several models were compared and we discussed the sensitivity of trends with regard to the underlying model. Whatever the model, we could estimate trends of considerable amplitude: most of them are increases of basal area growth of +25 to +50% between 1930 and 1990. Our results confirm very closely those gained by dendrochronological methods. Curiously, Oak stands from Normandie have a more complex trend: decreasing productivity between 1930 and 1960, then increase until now.},

We used a network of 35 permanent plots observed over 60 years, for which age and date were reasonably independent, and silviculture had been accurately recorded. Stand basal area increment varied markedly over the past 60 years. At two of the four sites studied, the normalised trend in basal area increment increased by between 25 and 55%, depending on the underlying model for the age factor. The westernmost site (Normandie) showed a more complex trend (decreasing productivity until 1960, increasing thereafter). Problems remain concerning the generalization of these results to other species and regions, using dominant height as a summary of productivity. The extrapolation of past growth curves over the next 100 years is also discussed.},

We used the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis database to evaluate the drivers of tree mortality for eastern temperate forest at the individual-level across spatial scales from tree to landscape to region. We investigated 13 covariates in four categories: climate, air pollutants, topography, and stand characteristics. Overall, we found that tree mortality was most sensitive to stand characteristics and air pollutants. Different functional groups also varied considerably in their sensitivity to environmental drivers. This research highlights the importance of considering the interactions among multiple global change agents in shaping forest ecosystems.},

Empirical studies showing positive stability-diversity relationships have, for the most part, used a single class of stability (or, more accurately, instability) measures: the temporal variation in aggregate community properties such as biomass or productivity. We show that for these measures, stability will essentially always rise with species diversity because of the statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species' abundances. This simple probabilistic process will operate in the absence of any strong species interactions, although its strength is driven by the relative abundances of species, as well as by the existence of positive or negative correlations in the fluctuations of species. To explore the possible importance of this effect in real communities, we fit a simple simulation model to Tilman's grassland community. Our results indicate that statistical averaging might play a substantial role in explaining stability-diversity correlations for this and other systems. Models of statistical averaging can serve as a useful baseline for predictions of community stability, to which the influences of both negative and positive species interactions may then be added and tested.},

  abstract = {Pedunculate (Quercus robur) and sessile (Quercus petraea) oak, dominant species in European hardwood forests, are declining in many regions throughout Europe and extreme climatic events (summer drought, winter frost) are considered to be key factors contributing to this decline via a negative effect on wood formation. An extensive sampling of scattered oak trees within a landscape of small groves and flower meadows in the White Carpathians, a hilly chain in the warm south-eastern part of the Czech Republic, was undertaken in order to determine the association between growth in diameter and climate over the last 100 years. The association with climate was evaluated by comparing late wood, early wood and total ring widths with monthly climatic data over the period 1900-2006, using a combination of response function and pointer year analyses. The two approaches clearly showed that late wood growth of oak trees, growing on deep calcium-rich soils, which dry out in summer, is mainly associated with rainfall in May June, while early wood growth is associated with previous autumn and winter temperatures. Extreme growth years coincided with an abnormally wet or dry May June periods, which are often associated with cool or hot Junes. Deficient water balances resulting from low rainfall and high temperatures during the summer period are negatively associated with late wood formation and hence total annual growth increment. The results provide support for a crucial role of climate change (decline in rainfall and increase in summer temperatures over the last three decades) among other external factors in the high number of oaks dying prematurely in the White Carpathian wooded grasslands. Prolonged periods of unfavourable climatic conditions cause attenuated trees to become prone to fungal attack and mistletoe hemiparasites, which predispose the oaks to damage or death, especially solitary pedunculate oaks.},

Currently, models for species distribution (SDMs) and tree growth are used to investigate the response of tree species to climate. However, both approaches were only applied separately so far. In this study, SDMs and growth models for Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba and Pinus sylvestris were calculated based on the German national forest inventories. We asked whether there is a positive relation between a tree species’ occurrence and its growth and what can be learned by their joint interpretation. The two approaches resulted in different patterns with respect to the considered environmental variables. Tree growth and occurrence probabilities were not positively correlated. This may be explained by the influence of forest pathogens and competition on species distribution by means of an increase in mortality. We concluded that the consideration of demographic processes as drivers of species distribution improves the reliability of estimates for site suitability and additionally provides information on productivity.},

These changes may continue during the old-growth life stages following the juvenile phase and are reflected in tree-ring properties such as growth increment, density or stable isotopes. We studied possible climate age effects in time series of several tree-ring parameters (ring width, wood density and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes) of mature individuals from two age groups of Pinus uncinata and P. nigra at two locations in Spain. The aim was to test whether age differences in trees in the old-growth life stages could lead to diverging climate responses. The results show some differences in response to climate between age groups at a monthly level, but most of these divergences are not significant for seasonal climate variables. Regardless of the age group, the main limiting climate factors constrained tree growth equally. Although our findings do not support the idea of an age-dependent response to climate that may lead to inaccurate climate reconstructions, further studies using tree-ring density and stable isotope series are urgently needed to verify the current results.},

  abstract = {What determines the seasonal and interannual variation of growth rates in trees in a tropical forest? We explore this question with a novel four-year high-temporal-resolution data set of carbon allocation from two forest plots in the Bolivian Amazon. The forests show strong seasonal variation in tree wood growth rates, which are largely explained by shifts in carbon allocation, and not by shifts in total productivity. At the deeper soil plot, there was a clear seasonal trade-off between wood and canopy NPP, while the shallower soils plot showed a contrasting seasonal trade-off between wood and fine roots. Although a strong 2010 drought reduced photosynthesis, NPP remained constant and increased in the six-month period following the drought, which indicates usage of significant nonstructural carbohydrate stores. Following the drought, carbon allocation increased initially towards the canopy, and then in the following year, allocation increased towards fine-root production. Had we only measured woody growth at these sites and inferred total NPP, we would have misinterpreted both the seasonal and interannual responses. In many tropical forest ecosystems, we propose that changing tree growth rates are more likely to reflect shifts in allocation rather than changes in overall productivity. Only a whole NPP allocation perspective can correctly interpret the relationship between changes in growth and changes in productivity.},

It has been concluded that the observed stomatal closure was accompanied by strong disorders at chloroplast level, which happened without visible waterlogging-induced deficiencies in mineral nutrient supply. Reactions to partial water-logging were much more limited. F silvatica displayed the strongest disorders in response to both treatments, Q robur showed only slight stress effects in response to partial water-logging and Q rubra had intermediate behaviour. These observations are in agreement with the reported differences in sensitivity to water-logging of adult trees in the stand. The precise chain of events leading to these disorders in the shoots of water-logged seedlings remains to be elucidated.},

A forest dynamics model was built in order to represent this evolution. The processes considered are tree growth, tree mortality and recruitment of seedlings, taking into account even those seed stands located several hundreds of meters away. The model also deals with site conditions and reduction of competition by way of various kinds of cutting (including regeneration cutting, precommercial thinning). Simulations can be performed for one or a number of forest compartments or for a whole forest or landscape. The relevance of simulation results depends on the input information. In order for this model to become a decision tool to design cutting plans or for managing a whole forest, the simulation software needs to be improved in the area of implementation of silvicultural rules and, moreover, stand description methods must be refined, joint efforts involving both scientists and forest managers are therefore needed.},

Four new white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) ring-width chronologies from four sites along a 30 kilometer north-south transect in the Lake Clark National Park and Preserve on the Alaskan Peninsula span a common interval from AD 1769 to 2003. Two sites show an internally consistent positive growth response to increasing April-July temperatures after 1950. The two other sites each contain two subpopulations showing varying growth responses. One subpopulation diverges from historical temperature data after 1950 and one shows increased growth consistent with warming or exceeds expected growth increases. The growth decline may be due to temperature-induced drought stress that acts on some trees. Unprecedented climatic changes are triggering diverse growth responses between and within study sites that may greatly complicate dendroclimatic reconstructions of past climate conditions.},

  abstract = {To understand how the future climate will affect the boreal forest, we studied growth responses to climate variability in black spruce ( Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) and trembling aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.), two major co-occurring boreal tree species of the eastern Canadian boreal forest. We analysed climate-growth interaction during (i) periods of non-anomalous growth and (ii) in years with strong growth anomalies. We utilized paired tree-level data for both growth and soil variables, which helped ensure that the studied growth variability was a function of species-specific biology, and not of within stand variation in soil conditions. Redundancy analysis conducted on spruce and aspen tree ring chronologies showed that their growth was affected differently by climate. During non-anomalous years, growth of spruce was favoured by cooler temperatures and wetter conditions, while aspen growth was favoured by higher temperatures and drier conditions. Black spruce and trembling aspen also showed an inverse pattern in respect to expression of growth anomalies (pointer years). A negative growth anomaly in spruce tended to be associated with positive ones in aspen and vice versa. This suggested that spruce and aspen had largely contrasting species-specific responses to both 'average' weather conditions and extreme weather events. Synthesis. Species-specific responses to environmental variability imply that tree responses to future climate will likely be not synchronized among species, which may translate into changes in structure and composition of future forest communities. In particular, we speculate that outcome of climate change in respect to relative abundance of black spruce and trembling aspen at the regional levels will be highly dependent on the balance between increasing temperatures and precipitation. Further, species-specific responses of trees to annual climate variability may enhance the resilience of mixed forests by constraining variability in their annual biomass accumulation, as compared with pure stands, under periods with high frequency of climatically extreme conditions.},

  abstract = {The observed long-term decrease in the regional fire activity of Eastern Canada results in excessive accumulation of organic layer on the forest floor of coniferous forests, which may affect climate-growth relationships in canopy trees. To test this hypothesis, we related tree-ring chronologies of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) to soil organic layer (SOL) depth at the stand scale in the lowland forests of Quebec's Clay Belt. Late-winter and early-spring temperatures and temperature at the end of the previous year's growing season were the major monthly level environmental controls of spruce growth. The effect of SOL on climate-growth relationships was moderate and reversed the association between tree growth and summer aridity from a negative to a positive relationship: trees growing on thin organic layers were thus negatively affected by drought, whereas it was the opposite for sites with deep (> 20-30 cm) organic layers. This indicates the development of wetter conditions on sites with thicker SOL. Deep SOL were also associated with an increased frequency of negative growth anomalies (pointer years) in tree-ring chronologies. Our results emphasize the presence of nonlinear growth responses to SOL accumulation, suggesting 20-30 cm as a provisional threshold with respect to the effects of SOL on the climate-growth relationship. Given the current climatic conditions characterized by generally low-fire activity and a trend toward accumulation of SOL, the importance of SOL effects in the black spruce ecosystem is expected to increase in the future.},

  abstract = {In the present context of global climate changes and the continuous development of forest management strategies based on the concept of sustainable use, it is important to develop a better understanding of the climatic factors controlling the growth of boreal forests. In this study, we report the results of a five-year field research within which day-to-day balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L) Mill.) stem diameter variation was measured with dendrometers and examined in relation with various daily climatic variables. A model built with data from three growing seasons that included solar radiation, relative humidity, temperature and precipitation explained 84% of the variance in day-to-day stem diameter variation from June to September. The model has approximately the same predictive capability when validated with independent daily data from two other growing seasons. The model captured both the cumulative increment associated with the irreversible growth and the high frequency variation of day-to-day fluctuations associated to changes in the stem water content. In general, rainy days during which relative humidity was high and solar radiation was low favored stem diameter expansion (growth and swelling) while stem diameter decreased during periods of low relative humidity and high solar radiation. Similar models were obtained when the June-September period was divided into two parts (June-July and August-September) to better represent the period during which most of the cumulative annual stem increment is observed (June-July). Inter-annual variation in stem growth computed from the modeled day-to-day variation in stem diameter was significantly correlated to the inter-annual variation in annual growth determined from tree core measurements over a 10 year period (p = 0.023). The model was notably able to capture a particularly poor growing year (2006) presumably due to a short-term heat stress period. Results suggest that the inclusion of daily data in growth-climate models may contribute to improve predictions of the potential tree growth response to climate by identifying particular climatic events that may escape to a classical dendroclimatic approach.

Our definition includes some randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM, or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary definitions of residuals fail.

  abstract = {Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term (&gt;50 yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives. As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems, such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic modelling is an important tool for understanding the impacts of climate change and pollutants on forest growth. One of the common practical limitations of these models is a lack of specific information regarding management activities such as thinning or harvesting, which can have a very strong influence on the accuracy of results. The use of inventory data for model para-meterization and calibration is also problematic, as inventories are designed to have large volumes of data amalgamated to give accurate mean results across large areas. The precision of single point estimates is often quite low. This study uses BIOME-BGC to model forest growth on 1133 sites of the Austrian National Forest Inventory, and develops a method to estimate timber removal patterns prior to the commencement of record keeping on the sites. Recognizing the poor precision of individual point estimates in the data, we do not seek to precisely calibrate the model to the data on each point. Rather, we assume that the point-wise inventory estimates will be normally distributed around the true values. We then model each site assuming no management interventions, and compare this with inventory results. Plotting the "error" between model results and NFI data shows a strong right-skew, reflecting the modelled lack of timber removals. A Box-Cox transformation of the error plot, centred on zero, would represent an unbiased model estimate of the data, thus we can determine the historic timber removals as the difference between the original error curve and its Box-Cox transformation. Calibrating the model with this information allow us to represent forest volume with greater accuracy than would otherwise be possible.},

Tree species composition among study areas was deliberately allowed to vary. Aspen, primarily quaking (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and to a lesser degree bigtooth (Populus grandidentata Michx.), was a significant component of every study area. The two most common associates were paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Productivity was defined as mean annual increment of tree stemwood volume and ranged from 3.3 to 12.6 m(3).ha(-1).year(-1). A multiple-regression approach was used to investigate the relationships between productivity, stand composition, and canopy structure. Base models relating productivity to aspen site index, aspen cohort age, and total basal area were developed. Measures of stand composition and canopy vertical structure were added to the base models, and their significance in explaining residual variation in productivity was tested. Productivity was found to be negatively correlated with stand composition and canopy vertical structure, with all other factors held constant. Pure aspen and single-canopied stands were expected to be the most productive. Exceptions were present in the data: the two most productive stands were vertically stratified, aspen - balsam fir - paper birch mixtures.},

  abstract = {Forests of the future should be resistant to exacerbating climatic conditions, especially to increasing drought, but at the same time provide a sufficient amount and quality of timber. In this context coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)) is a promising species since it remains productive even under chronic drought. By choosing suitable provenances within the range of Douglas-fir (P. menziesii (Mirb.)) for a given site we can further optimise tree fitness under dry conditions or even increase timber yield. Eighteen coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) var. menziesii) provenances were tested for seedling survival, yield, wood quality, and drought tolerance by taking advantage of a Dutch provenance trial, established in 1971 within the framework of the 1966/1967 IUFRO seed collection program. The site of the Dutch trial is representative for many sites in Central Europe and is characterised by a moderate precipitation and temperature regime. Measurements on height and diameter growth were combined with a dendrochronological study on growth response to drought years. We found a clear latitudinal trend indicating that Douglas-fir provenances from the northern part of the species-distribution range are generally more productive than provenances from the south. In contrast, drought tolerance increased towards the south. This suggests that it is impossible to identify provenances combining maximum productivity with lowest susceptibility towards drought. However, based on the results from the trial we can give recommendations on suitable provenances that are expected to perform best under future conditions in Central Europe. On sites where severe drought events are unlikely to occur in future, fast growing provenances from the north, like Nimkish, should be planted. These provenances respond plastically to drought years, but the strong reduction of tree growth in the drought year itself indicates that these provenances will be harmed by an increasing frequency of drought events. However, on sites where water availability is likely to decrease, provenances from the Olympic Peninsula like Forks and Matlock are very promising since they showed still relatively high yield in combination with a high potential to cope with drought. If summer drought increases in frequency and severity as expected, the latewood/earlywood ratio will be drastically reduced with negative consequences for wood quality and cavitation resistance. However, some provenances, like Marblemount or Matlock, might compensate for the negative effect of summer drought on latewood/earlywood ratio by the contribution of photosynthesis in winter to whole-year carbon stock.

  abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

  abstract = {A general theory of allometric scaling that predicts how the proportions of vascular plants and the characteristics of plant communities change or scale with plant size is outlined. The theory rests, in part, on the assumptions of (1) minimal energy dissipation in the transport of fluid through space-filling, fractal-like, branching vascular networks; and (2) the absence of scaling with plant size in the anatomical and physiological attributes of leaves and xylem. The theory shows how the scaling of metabolism with plant size is central to the scaling of whole-plant form and function. It is shown how allometric constraints influence plant populations and, potentially, processes in plant evolution. Rapidly accumulating evidence in support of the general allometric model is reviewed and new evidence is presented. Current work supports the notion that scaling of how plants utilize space and resources is central to the development of a general synthetic and quantitative theory of plant form, function, ecology and diversity.},

  abstract = {Here, we present the second part of a quantitative theory for the structure and dynamics of forests under demographic and resource steady state. The theory is based on individual-level allometric scaling relations for how trees use resources, fill space, and grow. These scale up to determine emergent properties of diverse forests, including size–frequency distributions, spacing relations, canopy configurations, mortality rates, population dynamics, successional dynamics, and resource flux rates. The theory uniquely makes quantitative predictions for both stand-level scaling exponents and normalizations. We evaluate these predictions by compiling and analyzing macroecological datasets from several tropical forests. The close match between theoretical predictions and data suggests that forests are organized by a set of very general scaling rules. Our mechanistic theory is based on allometric scaling relations, is complementary to “demographic theory,” but is fundamentally different in approach. It provides a quantitative baseline for understanding deviations from predictions due to other factors, including disturbance, variation in branching architecture, asymmetric competition, resource limitation, and other sources of mortality, which are not included in the deliberately simplified theory. The theory should apply to a wide range of forests despite large differences in abiotic environment, species diversity, and taxonomic and functional composition.},

  abstract = {Planting with mixtures of tree species rather than single species is often considered during reforestation because of the potential increased productivity and other benefits. We examined tree growth at the stand and individual tree scales in two experiments contrasting monocultures with a 1:1 mixture of tree species: (1) Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) with a conifer of similar shade tolerance (western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl. ex D. Don)) and (2) Douglas-fir with a more shade-tolerant conifer (western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.)). There was no effect of mixture on growth or yield in the Douglas-fir - western white pine combination. In the Douglas-fir - western hemlock combination, yields in the mixture equaled those in Douglas-fir stands because of the enhanced performance of Douglas-fir in the mixture. For Douglas-fir, the height/diameter (h/d) ratio was significantly less in mixture, suggesting reduced competition for light when grown with western hemlock. In contrast, the h/d ratio for western hemlock was significantly greater in mixture, suggesting increased competition for light when grown with Douglas-fir. Neighborhood analyses showed that tree growth was directly related to initial size and inversely related to relative neighbor size and that the h/d ratio was positively related to relative neighbor size. In general, the size of a neighboring tree influenced growth more than species identity. Relationships between h/d ratios and growth rates suggest that growth differences between Douglas-fir and western hemlock in mixture will eventually increase.},

  abstract = {Snags (standing dead trees) are an essential structural component of forests. Because wildlife use of snags depends on size and decay stage, snag density estimation without any information about snag quality attributes is of little value for wildlife management decision makers. Little work has been done to develop models that allow multivariate estimation of snag density by snag quality class. Using climate, topography, Landsat TM data, stand age and forest type collected for 2356 forested Forest Inventory and Analysis plots in western Washington and western Oregon, we evaluated two multivariate techniques for their abilities to estimate density of snags by three decay classes. The density of live trees and snags in three decay classes (D1: recently dead, little decay; D2: decay, without top, some branches and bark missing; D3: extensive decay, missing bark and most branches) with diameter at breast height (DBH) ⩾ 12.7 cm was estimated using a nonparametric random forest nearest neighbor imputation technique (RF) and a parametric two-stage model (QPORD), for which the number of trees per hectare was estimated with a Quasipoisson model in the first stage and the probability of belonging to a tree status class (live, D1, D2, D3) was estimated with an ordinal regression model in the second stage. The presence of large snags with DBH ⩾ 50 cm was predicted using a logistic regression and RF imputation. Because of the more homogenous conditions on private forest lands, snag density by decay class was predicted with higher accuracies on private forest lands than on public lands, while presence of large snags was more accurately predicted on public lands, owing to the higher prevalence of large snags on public lands. RF outperformed the QPORD model in terms of percent accurate predictions, while QPORD provided smaller root mean square errors in predicting snag density by decay class. The logistic regression model achieved more accurate presence/absence classification of large snags than the RF imputation approach. Adjusting the decision threshold to account for unequal size for presence and absence classes is more straightforward for the logistic regression than for the RF imputation approach. Overall, model accuracies were poor in this study, which can be attributed to the poor predictive quality of the explanatory variables and the large range of forest types and geographic conditions observed in the data.},

  abstract = {A potential limitation of tree-ring based climate reconstructions is related to climate signal age effects (CSAE). CSAE may arise if the climatic response of young tree-rings differs from that of old tree-rings. This could mean that climatic signals become stronger (or weaker) with tree aging, or that the seasonality of signals or the sensitivity to a specific element (e.g., temperature, precipitation) changes over time. Such changes would affect the interpretation of dendroclimatic reconstructions, as the tree-rings included in these records are generally oldest at the end of a record (e.g., 21 st century)-which is the time period generally used for calibration with instrumental data. We here addressed this concern by analyzing young and old Pinus cembra trees from three high elevation sites in the central European Alps. Core and disc samples were collected in pre-defined plots to allow for a representative analysis of tree ages with tree-ring width (TRW) measurement series categorized into age classes (i) >1880, (ii) 1880-1939, and (iii) 1940-2002. Notably we report on the signal of the very young category (iii) not yet described in literature, and thus allow estimation of climate response and signal strength characteristics during the first years of the trees' lifespans. Comparison of age classes (i)-(iii) revealed differences in TRW coherence and size, but little change in climatic signal. CSAE are in the order of the differences recorded among high elevation sites-a conclusion that holds for inter-annual to decadal scale TRW variations at near-treeline Swiss stone pine. Such data are typically included in regional and larger-scale temperature reconstructions; thus, our results add confidence to long-term climate estimates integrating a range of tree-ring age classes. Other findings, such as the reaction wood in juvenile tree-rings, and sensitivity of the climate signal to sample replication, suggest that comparisons of young and old age classes, and separate calibration of these categories against instrumental climate data might further the estimation of long-term uncertainty changes in tree-ring based climate reconstructions.

  abstract = {Forest growth is affected by various concurrent and counteracting climate change related factors and the overall impact of environmental changes on forest growth is still uncertain. In order to evaluate the variability of tree and forest growth and the possible impact of climate change, we analysed 15 years (1995-2010) of tree growth data from 18 Level II plots in Switzerland, spanning a wide range of altitude, temperature and precipitation conditions. Stem diameter of all trees within the Level II plots was measured every 5 years. Other above- and belowground parts of the trees were modelled by allometric relationships and validated with measurements if available. We analysed individual tree growth (basal area increment, bai) and the whole forest net primary productivity (NPP), here the sum of carbon gain by tree growth within the plot, during three inventory periods. Additionally, annual stem diameter increment, assessed on single trees at each plot since 2001, was used to approximate annual NPP of the forest. Temporal patterns of NPP could not easily be related to climate conditions, since forest management and disturbance events (e.g. storms, diseases) overshadowed the climate impact on NPP. However, when looking at the individual trees, a clear decrease of bai by 2-30% (mean 19.3%) was observed for most of the sites during the second inventory period (2000-2005), which could not solely be explained by increasing stand density overtime. Tree growth was most likely reduced due to the dry conditions during this period that included the extreme year 2003. An increased tree growth during the third inventory period (2006-2010) at a few sites could be clearly related to growth enhancement after stand density reducing events, such as storms or thinning. Thus, understanding climate impact on forest growth requires detailed site history knowledge and available long-term data sets. The variability of mean NPP levels could be described with a function of the sites' climate conditions and nutrient deposition (adj. r(2) = 0.86), with N deposition enhancing forest productivity up to a threshold of 20-25 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of N and with no further growth increase beyond that threshold.

Because of climate change, foresters on managed lands should take into account changes in species composition, more frequent disturbances, potential changes in growth rates, and distorted insect and disease dynamics. Silvicultural prescriptions should emphasize low impact logging techniques, the perpetuation of structural complexity, legacy trees, extended rotations, and uneven aged management systems where appropriate.

When applied to the simulation of tree-ring widths from North America and Russia from the Mann et al. (1998) and Vaganov et al. (2006) data sets, the forward model produces skill on annual and decadal timescales which is about the same as that achieved using classical dendrochronological statistical modeling techniques. The forward model achieves this without site-by-site tuning as is performed in statistical modeling. The results support the interpretation of this broad-scale network of tree-ring width chronologies primarily as climate proxies for use in statistical paleoclimatic field reconstructions, and point to further applications in climate science.},

Multiple management objectives can often be accommodated by multiaged stand structures. Consequently, multiaged silviculture is increasingly considered in place of even-aged methods. When multiaged methods are adopted in commercial forestry settings, it is important to consider potential impacts to wood production. Evaluating wood production efficiency (usually expressed as periodic annual increment per unit leaf area) of different sized trees in multiaged stands helps illuminate the effects of stand structure on productivity. Growth dominance analysis is an alternative method that compares proportion of stand biomass or volume carried by trees with the proportion they produce. We analyzed production efficiency patterns in multiaged ponderosa pine stands and compared results to trends in growth dominance. Small trees in multiaged stands were ~20% less efficient than large trees, yet we found no overall difference between multiaged and even-aged structures. Surprisingly, dominance analysis implied that small trees were more productive than medium or large trees in multiaged stands. However, when dominance analysis was repeated using leaf area instead of stem volume as a metric of resource acquisition, this trend disappeared. Results indicated that multiaged prescriptions for wood production should consider production efficiency differences between size classes of trees and that growth dominance curves created using leaf area illustrate tree size-productivity trends in multiaged stands.},

The intra- and inter-site running correlations between tree-ring series may be related to shifts in environmental stress. Persistently declining drought response of tree growth at Mount Emei may be related to the moss-induced "swamping effect". Diebacks at Mount Emei at similar to 1974 may have been caused by sharply elevated levels of pollutants from a forest fire in 1972. Tree growth at the two lower sites at Xinglong Mountain shows positive correlations with moisture during a water-year, while a negative drought response is seen at the uppermost site. An increase in drought sensitivity of tree growth is observed under the persistent drying trend in recent decades at the Xinglong Mountain.},

  abstract = {The dependence of forest productivity and community composition on rainfall is the result of complex interactions at multiple scales, from the physiology of carbon gain and water loss to competition among individuals and species. In an effort to understand the role of these multiscale interactions in the dependence of forest structure on rainfall, we build a tractable model of individual plant competition for water and light. With game-theoretic analyses, we predict the dominant plant allocation strategy, forest productivity, and carbon storage. We find that the amount and timing of rainfall are critical to forest structure. Comparing two forests that differ only in the total time plants spend in water saturation, the model predicts that the wetter forest has fewer fine roots, more leaves, and more woody biomass than the drier forest. In contrast, if two forests differ only in the amount of water available during water limitation, the model predicts that the wetter forest has more fine roots than the drier forest and equivalent leaves and woody biomass. The difference in these responses to increases in water availability has significant implications for potential carbon sinks with rising atmospheric CO2. We predict that enhanced productivity from increased leaf-level water-use efficiency during water limitation will be allocated to fine roots if plants respond competitively, producing only a small and short-lived carbon sink.},

  abstract = {Almost all models of plant resource limitation are grounded in either one or both of two simple conceptual models: Liebig's Minimum Hypothesis (LMH), the idea that plants are limited by the resource in shortest supply, and the Multiple Limitation Hypothesis (MLH), the idea that plants should adjust to their environment so that all essential resources are equally limiting. Despite the differences in their predictions, experiments have so far failed to discriminate between them. In a simple factorial nitrogen and water addition experiment in a Minnesota grassland, we observed shifts in allocation that, as in previous studies, are not all explained by a single theory. We found that leaf biomass responded positively to nitrogen additions but did not respond to water additions. We found that fine-root biomass increased in response to water additions, but only at low nitrogen levels, and that fine-root biomass decreased in response to nitrogen additions, but only at high water levels. To understand these responses we built a physiologically based model of plant competition for water, nitrogen, and space to predict plant allocation to fine roots and leaves. Critically, we include in our model the inherent variability of soil moisture and treat light, water, and nitrogen as resources with distinct mechanistic roles. Experimental results showed that plants were nitrogen and water limited. The model explains the experimental results, under conditions of co-limitation, as follows. Foliage increases with nitrogen additions but not water additions because leaf construction is constrained by nitrogen uptake. When water is added, plants spend a larger fraction of the growing season limited by light (and effectively nitrogen) than by water. Thus, water additions cause fine-root biomass to increase because of the increased importance of nitrogen limitation. The response of fine-root biomass to water additions decreases with nitrogen additions because these additions reduce nitrogen limitation. In general, our results are explained by sequential resource limitation. The rate of carbon assimilation may be limited by a single resource at any one moment, but the identity of the limiting resource(s) changes throughout the growing season.},

  abstract = {Reducing uncertainty in forest carbon estimates at local and regional scales has become increasingly important due to the centrality of the terrestrial carbon cycle in issues of climate change. Despite relatively limited geographical extent, temperate forests are among the most carbon dense forests in the world. Estimates of carbon in key understorey life forms and belowground components of these forests have often been excluded from previous studies in south-eastern Australia. We estimated above- and belowground carbon stocks (including soil to 0.3 m depth) in stands of cool temperate rainforest (‘rainforest’), wet sclerophyll forest (‘eucalypt forest’), and mixed rainforest–wet sclerophyll stands (‘ecotone forest’) across a wide range of environmental conditions and forest structures. We examined relationships among component carbon stocks and a range of environmental variables (edaphic, climatic, spatial) and present the first allometric equations and carbon stock estimates for south-eastern Australian tree ferns. Component carbon stocks were within the range of published values for these stand types. Using multivariate analyses of all component stocks, we detected significantly more carbon in total above- and belowground components in ecotone (697 Mg ha−1, 95% confidence interval 575–819 Mg ha−1) and eucalypt forests (689 Mg ha−1, 605–773 Mg ha−1) than rainforest (550 Mg ha−1, 453–647 Mg ha−1). However, we found no significant differences among the stand types in the proportional distribution of carbon among components despite significant differences in structural composition as indicated by size class distributions of the main genera. Of total carbon, ∼48% was stored in trees (&gt;2 cm over-bark diameter), and ∼72% of tree carbon was stored in the largest 10% of all trees. The most important environmental variables associated with carbon stocks irrespective of stand type were edaphic variables, most commonly total and available soil nitrogen. Tree fern carbon was the only component stock more strongly associated with climatic and spatial than edaphic variables. Our findings indicate that disturbance mediated changes in stand dynamics could significantly alter total carbon stocks, particularly if more frequent fires limit tree recruitment and increase large tree mortality. Monitoring of these forests for carbon could place greater emphasis on key structural elements associated with the largest proportion of total carbon, the largest trees. By reducing uncertainties associated with estimates of carbon in key stocks, we can better understand potential future changes to the carbon cycle from altered stand dynamics under climate change.},

  abstract = {More stressful conditions are expected due to climatic change in several regions, including Patagonia, South-America. In this region, there are no studies about the impact of severe drought events on growth and wood characteristics of the most planted forestry species, Pinus ponderosa (Doug. ex-Laws). The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of a severe drought event on annual stem growth and functional wood anatomy of pines growing at different plantation densities aiming to understand how management practices can help to increase their adaptability to climate change. Growth magnitude and period, specific hydraulic conductivity, and anatomical traits (early- and latewood proportion, lumen diameter, cell-wall thickness, tracheid length and bordered pit dimensions) were measured in the ring 2008-2009, which was formed during drought conditions. This drought event decreased annual stem growth by 30-38% and 58-65% respect to previous mean growth, in open vs. closed stand trees, respectively, indicating a higher sensitivity of the latter, which is opposite to reports from the same species growing in managed native forests in USA. Some wood anatomical variables did differ in more water stressed trees (lower cell wall thickness of earlywood cells and higher proportion of small-lumen cells in latewood), which in turn did not affect wood function (hydraulic conductivity and resistance to implosion). Other anatomical variables (tracheid length, pit dimensions, early- and latewood proportion, lumen diameter of earlywood cells) did not differ between tree sizes and plantation density. The results suggest that severe drought affects differentially the amount but not the function and quality of formed wood in ponderosa pine growing at different competition levels.},

  abstract = {New forest management approaches aim to ensure high biodiversity and climatic adaptability. Silvicultural practices can alter treetree interactions and thus influence forest structure and composition. However, knowledge of the interacting effects of competitive and abiotic stress in tree communities is still limited. We assessed growth dynamics of European beech Fagus sylvatica in oligo- to eutrophic lowland beech forests by quantifying variation in the importance and intensity of competitive interactions among adult trees along a productivity gradient defined by nutrient availability and hydrological characteristics. We further predicted changes in competition indices with various levels of crowding for different forest types. Basal area growth of 1819 canopy trees was analysed using forest inventory data. Competition response of adult trees was inconsistent among forest types. For small timber trees, the intensity (absolute effect) and importance (effect relative to abiotic constraints) of competition decreased with increasing abiotic stress. Growth responses of medium and large timber trees, however, revealed an opposite trend. Thus, in tree communities, competition effects did not follow a general pattern, because tree maturation altered the responsiveness of trees to environmental stress. Resource dependency of competition effects was most pronounced for large timber trees, with lowest sensitivity to changes in crowding conditions occurring on fertile sites. For small and medium timber trees, however, competition effects were strongest in dense stands, with lowest sensitivity to changes in crowding conditions on resource-limited sites. Synthesis and applications. Treetree interactions in beech forests showed a clear pattern which depended on tree maturation and resource supply. This highlights the importance of considering tree size-related changes along environmental gradients in regional growth models. Our findings indicate that management practices could facilitate both timber production and nature conservation demands by adapting thinning approaches to age- and resource-related tree growth patterns. We propose a distinct reduction in thinning intensity, particularly for larger beech trees growing on sites with optimum below-ground resources. This would increase the permanent stand volumes and promote natural stand dynamics, which in turn would benefit biodiversity typical of old-growth beech forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Forests are experiencing an environment that changes much faster than during the past several hundred years. In addition, the abiotic factors determining forest dynamics vary depending on its location. Forest modeling thus faces the new challenge of supporting forest management in the context of environmental change. This review focuses on three types of models that are used in forest management: empirical (EM), process-based (PBM) and hybrid models. Recent approaches may lead to the applicability of empirical models under changing environmental conditions, such as (i) the dynamic state-space approach, or (ii) the development of productivity-environment relationships. Twenty-five process-based models in use in Europe were analyzed in terms of their structure, inputs and outputs having in mind a forest management perspective. Two paths for hybrid modeling were distinguished: (i) coupling of EMs and PBMs by developing signal-transfer environment-productivity functions; (ii) hybrid models with causal structure including both empirical and mechanistic components. Several gaps of knowledge were identified for the three types of models reviewed. The strengths and weaknesses of the three model types differ and all are likely to remain in use. There is a trade-off between how little data the models need for calibration and simulation purposes, and the variety of input-output relationships that they can quantify. PBMs are the most versatile, with a wide range of environmental conditions and output variables they can account for. However, PBMs require more data making them less applicable whenever data for calibration are scarce. EMs, on the other hand, are easier to run as they require much less prior information, but the aggregated representation of environmental effects makes them less reliable in the context of environmental changes. The different disadvantages of PBMs and EMs suggest that hybrid models may be a good compromise, but a more extensive testing of these models in practice is required.},

This small area is spread across the mountainous areas of the north and centre of the country. This study models Douglas-fir productivity based on site factors and estimates the potential area for Douglas-fir in Portugal. Soil, climate and topographic data were collected on 39 plots across the range of sites where Douglas-fir grows in Portugal. The analysis of the data followed three steps: (1) selection of site factors related to the variation in the site index; (2) choice of candidate models; and (3) consideration of the best model to explain and predict the site index from site factor variables. The best multiple linear regression model explained 90 per cent of site index variation but included variables not readily available in the field. A model using digitized site data explained 54 per cent of the variation in the site index and mapped the areas with potential for Douglas-fir growth in Portugal. It is estimated that a potential Douglas-fir planting area of 250 000 ha exists where trees will exceed 17 m dominant height at age 30 years. This would correspond to 8 per cent of the existing Portuguese forest area. The best sites for Douglas-fir growth are located along north coastal to central regions at altitudes between 500 m and 1000 m with moisture deficit (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) above 1000 mm. Areas with acceptable sites for Douglas-fir growth are located in the north and centre of Portugal at 700-1000 m elevation and have a moisture deficit above 400 mm.},

Intra-specific competition was consistently associated with development of a positively skewed but bimodal distribution of plant size, an even spatial distribution of large plants and, when mortality occurred, of survivors, and higher relative growth rates (RGR) of a distinct set of individuals which form an upper canopy. Plants of Tagetes patula sown in a lattice arrangement show three stages in community development: (i) the establishment of local hierarchies during the seedling phase when RGR is linearly related to plant weight; (ii) the development of a distinct upper canopy of large plants which are evenly distributed in space and have similar maximal RGRs; (iii) stability in the upper canopy but mortality of small plants which results in an even distribution of survivors. Yoda et al. (1963) suggested that in plant monocultures during the self-thinning phase there is a constant change in mean plant weight for unit change in plant density, the 3/2 power law. This is held not to apply universally but to be dependent upon the relationship between canopy morphology and stand dynamics which influences production efficiency.},

Plant morphology determines both patterns of resource acquisition and the condition of the internal environment of the tree. Empirical evidence in support of these claims is presented and a theory is specified for the morphological control of physiological processes in crown and canopy growth. Three important postulates of this theory are that (1) multiple structural characters influence resource acquisition, (2) characters are not constant during tree growth but change over time, and (3) both the external and internal environment of the tree change over time. Two models are presented that are based on the principle that morphology determines patterns of resource acquisition and subsequent growth. One model, WHORL, simulates competition and, particularly, the effects of tree plasticity on the competition outcome. The other model, BRANCH, illustrates how different degrees of modular autonomy, when given to the component shoots of a branch, may markedly alter the patterns of foliage weight supported and estimates of export of photosynthate from the branch to the rest of the tree.},

  abstract = {Abstract There is great interest in how species interactions change along spatial gradients in resource availability and climatic conditions. Many studies have shown that facilitation or complementary effects increase as growing conditions become harsher, however, several studies in forests have recently shown the opposite trend. Increasing complementary effects with improving growing conditions may result when species interactions influence light absorption or use. This hypothesis was tested in mixed-species forests of Abies alba Mill. and Picea abies (L.) Karst. in south-western Germany where complementary effects on growth increased as climatic conditions improved. The absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) by individual trees was predicted using a detailed light model. Light-use efficiency (LUE) of individual trees was estimated as basal area growth per unit APAR. APAR and LUE were modelled as functions of crown size, climatic variables and the species composition and density of the neighbourhood of individual trees. For a given tree size, APAR (for both species) and LUE (of A. alba trees) were greater for trees in mixed-species neighbourhoods than monospecific neighbourhoods and this complementary effect increased as climatic conditions improved and on sites with faster growing trees. Increases in APAR for A. alba probably resulted because shading from P. abies trees was less intense than that from other A. alba trees on the more productive site. The species composition of individual tree neighbourhoods did not influence relationships between stem diameter and crown diameter or height to the crown base, for either species. However, the height of each species, for a given stem diameter, increased as the proportion of a given tree’s neighbourhood basal area that was composed of the same species increased. This change in crown architecture could also have contributed to the complementarity effects in these stands. Increasing complementary effects with improving growing conditions is consistent with the stress-gradient hypothesis if competition for light is considered to be the stressor. This study shows that such a spatial pattern in species interactions could be associated with increasing differences in APAR or LUE between mixtures and monocultures as climatic conditions become more favourable.},

  abstract = {In this study, a diameter increment model was calibrated for individual trees in hardwood stands in Quebec, Canada. Two random effects, a first one for the plot and a second one for the time interval nested in the plot, and a covariance structure were included in the model to account for spatial and serial correlations. The diameter at breast height, species group, vigor and product classes, and basal area were the explanatory variables that were tested in this analysis. The adequacy of the covariance features (random effects and covariance structure) were tested through empirical correlations calculated from normalized residuals. A cross-validation was also carried out to evaluate the model. The normalized residuals showed no departure from the assumption of independently and normally distributed error terms with homogeneous variances. Consequently, the statistical inferences could be considered as valid. The results showed that the average diameter increment pattern differs among the species. Although tree product and vigor were significant explanatory variables, their effects were relatively small. On the other hand, basal area had a large and significant negative effect on diameter increment. Our study demonstrates that empirical correlations calculated from normalized residuals can be used as an additional tool to test the adequacy of the covariance features in a mixed-effects model.},

  year =     {2013},
  abstract = {Functional ecology has long considered the support function as important, but its biomechanical complexity is only just being elucidated. We show here that it can be described on the basis of four biomechanical traits, two safety traits against winds and self-buckling, and two motricity traits involved in sustaining an upright position, tropic motion velocity (MV) and posture control (PC). All these traits are integrated at the tree scale, combining tree size and shape together with wood properties. The assumption of trait constancy has been used to derive allometric scaling laws, but it was more recently found that observing their variations among environments and functional groups, or during ontogeny, provides more insights into adaptive syndromes of tree shape and wood properties. However, oversimplified expressions have often been used, possibly concealing key adaptive drivers. An extreme case of oversimplification is the use of wood basic density as a proxy for safety. Actually, as wood density is involved in stiffness, loads, and construction costs, the impact of its variations on safety is non-trivial. Moreover, other wood features, especially the microfibril angle (MFA), are also involved. Furthermore, wood is not only stiff and strong, but it also acts as a motor for MV and PC. The relevant wood trait for this is maturation strain asymmetry. Maturation strains vary with cell-wall characteristics such as MFA, rather than with wood density. Finally, the need for further studies about the ecological relevance of branching patterns, motricity traits, and growth responses to mechanical loads is discussed.},

I argue that the IDH has been refuted on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and so should be abandoned. Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted humped diversity–disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity–disturbance relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what they are thought to predict. Disturbances and other environmental fluctuations can affect diversity, but for different reasons than are commonly recognized.},

Models are based on the hollows component of the Statewide Forest Resource Inventory (SFRI), the most comprehensive database of hollow incidence in Australia. A two-stage methodology was used at the individual tree-level that in its first-stage generated a statement of the probability of hollows presence, and in its second-stage estimated the size of hollows. The hierarchical nature of SFRI data prompted the search for statistical methodology capable of explicitly modelling a complicated error structure. Subsequently, generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to estimate first-stage, tree-level models in the presence of spatial and nested dependence. The developed models were statistically and biologically plausible and performed well when validated using independent data. By overcoming the limitations facing previous research associated with insufficient data and inappropriate statistical methodology viable predictive models were developed. Tree-level models will help us understand patterns of hollow incidence, can be used for predictive purposes when individual-tree information is available, and can improve habitat tree retention guidelines.

  abstract = {The availability of tree hollows in timber production forests is a contentious issue facing forest and wildlife managers in Australia. To integrate conservation priorities for hollow-dependent fauna in forest stewardship, public land managers need information on the quantity and spatial distribution of hollow-bearing trees. This information has previously been lacking, but an extensive hollows database exists in the Victorian Statewide Forest Resource Inventory (SFRI). We use the SFRI to estimate simple stand-level models for the density of hollow-bearing trees, and the density of hollow size classes. Models were of borderline predictive ability but were statistically significant. This is consistent with previous models of hollow incidence that have found hollow formation to be intrinsically stochastic. We then applied these models in a geographic information system (GIS) to generate spatial predictions of hollow availability in Victorian state forests. The resulting GIS layers are available from the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and are a valuable resource for forest and wildlife managers, researchers and the interested public. We also created tables describing hollow abundance for different forest types, and important stand-level trends in hollow availability emerged. We found that hollow density in ash forests (Eucalyptus regnans, Eucalyptus delegatensis) was consistently low and strongly influenced by the presence of non-ash species that are more susceptible to hollow formation. Hollows occurred in E. regnans forest at particularly low density, with less than 37% of trees having hollows until diameter exceeded 125 cm. The density of hollows in non-ash forests was comparatively greater, with more than 49% of trees containing hollows when their diameter exceeded 75 cm.},

  abstract = {The growth and form of a modular organism is determined by the rigid rules of iteration (branching) and the differential response of each growing point to the local conditions around it. The degree of response of each individual module is itself dependent on the degree of physiological integration of the whole organism. Morphological continuity is a requisite but not a guarantee of physiological integration. In general, 'phalanx' growth-forms show more physiological integration than 'guerrilla' growth-forms. Trees, as an example of morphologically integrated modular organisms, show a variety of responses to the presence of modules both of the same and of different species. When two modules interact, three extreme responses are possible: (i) both modules stop growing or change their orientation, or both; (ii) one module is inhibited while the other continues its growth; (iii) neither is affected by the presence of the other. The first case produces a clear separation ('shyness') between neighbouring modules both within and between trees. The second case produces a hierarchy of dominance-suppression. Finally, failure to 'recognize' the presence of a neighbour module may result in physical damage by abrasion of both participants. Under certain circumstances, this can also produce a visual impression of 'shyness'. The importance of this 'recognition' mechanism is discussed for both modular animals and plants.},

  abstract = {For assessing forest thinning effects at large (i.e. continental) scale, data scarcity and technical limitations prevent the application of localized or individual-based thinning models. Here we present a simple general framework to analyze and predict the effects of thinning on growth and mortality, including the following stand density development. The effects are modeled in relative terms so that the model can be parameterized based on any thinning experiment that includes an unthinned control, regardless of site conditions and stand age. The model was tested against observed thinning effects on growth and mortality from five temperate and boreal species (all species pooled r(2) = 0.51). It predicted a maximum increase in net stem biomass increment of 16% and a reduction in density-related mortality of 75% compared to unthinned conditions at stand densities of around 70% of the maximum (increment optimal density). A sensitivity analysis revealed overlapping ranges of near optimal density (net increment within 95% of optimal) among all tested species, suggesting that one thinning scenario can be used for many species. The simple and general formulation of thinning effects based on only five parameters allows easy integration with a wide range of generic forest growth models.},

  abstract = {We analyze interannual to multi-decadal growth variations of 555 oak trees from Central-West Germany. A network of 13 pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and 33 sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) site chronologies is compared with gridded temperature, precipitation,. cloud-cover, vapor pressure and drought (i.e., Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI) fluctuations. A hierarchic cluster analysis identifies three groups for each oak species differentiated by ecologic settings. When high precipitation is primarily a characteristic for one Q. rohur and one Q. petraea cluster, the other clusters are more differentiated by prevailing temperature conditions. Correlation analysis with precipitation and vapor pressure reveals statistically significant (P <= 0.05) correlations for June (r = 0.51) and annual (r = 0.43) means. Growth of both species at dry sites correlates strongly with PDSI (r = 0.39, P <= 0.05) and weakly with temperature and cloud-cover. In natural stands, Q. robur responds more strongly to water depletion than Q. petraea. Twenty-one-year moving correlations show positive significant growth response to both PDSI and precipitation throughout the 20th century, except for the 1940s - an anomalously warm decade during which all oak sites are characterized by an increased growth and all enhanced association with vapor pressure and temperature. We Suggest that the wider oak rings that are exhibited during this period may be indicative of a nonlinear or threshold-induced growth response to drought and vapor pressure, and run counter to the general response of oak to drought and precipitation that normally would result ill Suppressed growth ill a warmer and drier environment. As the wide rings are formed during the severe drought period of the 20th century, a complex model seems to be required to fully explain the widespread oak growth. Our results indicate Uncertainty in estimates of future growth trends of Central European oak forests in a warming and drying world.},

The application of the principal component analysis generally leads to the most stable site classifications, whereas the most sensitive response to changes in the dataset is obtained by Ward's method. The average linkage method separates single sites in the classification and thus emphasises outliers within the tree-ring network. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

While site conditions in Central (similar to 51A degrees N, 9A degrees E, KEL) and West (50.5A degrees N, 6.5A degrees E, EIF) Germany are similar, annual precipitation totals of a parts per thousand...700 mm and a parts per thousand...1,000 mm describe a maritime-continental gradient. Ring-width samples from 228 trees were collected and PCA used to identify common growth patterns. Chronologies were developed and redundancy analysis and simple correlation coefficients calculated to detect twentieth century temperature, precipitation, and drought fingerprints in the tree-ring data. Summer drought is the dominant driver of forest productivity, but regional and species-specific differences indicate more complex influences upon tree growth. F. sylvatica reveals the highest climate sensitivity, whereas Q. petraea is most drought tolerant. Drier growth conditions in KEL result in climate sensitivity of all species, and Q. petraea shifted from non-significant to significant drought sensitivity during recent decades at EIF. Drought sensitivity dynamics of all species vary over time. An increase of drought sensitivity in tree growth was found in the wetter forest area EIF, whereas a decrease occurred in the middle of the last century for all species in the drier KEL region. Species-specific and regional differences in long-term climate sensitivities, as evidenced by temporal variability in drought sensitivity, are potential indicators for a changing climate that effects Central-West German forest growth, but meanwhile hampers a general assessment of these effects.},

They can be used to characterize modifications of forest structure resulting from silvicultural activity, to measure differences between forests in time and space, and to analyse the differences between observed and expected structures.},

  abstract = {A whole-stand survival model is presented, that is parsimonious and well-behaved when extrapolated, making it particularly useful in data-poor situations. It is argued, on biological and system-theoretical grounds, that a suitable differential equation for the mortality rate should contain number of trees and top height on the right-hand side, avoiding age, mean diameter, or basal area. Following Eichhorn's hypothesis, site quality can be neglected by modelling rates relative to height growth. The proposed model is d N/d H- aNbHc , where N is number of trees per unit area, H is top height, and a, b and c are parameters to be estimated. The equation can be integrated to predict mortality between any two points in time. Satisfactory performance is demonstrated with a white spruce data set from British Columbia. It is shown that the model generalizes concepts of relative spacing, and mortality models for radiata pine and Douglas-fir used by Beekhuis in New Zealand in the 1960's. Asymptotic behaviour is related to the 3/2, Reineke, and relative spacing self-thinning laws. Limitations of the self-thinning theories and relationships among their various forms are discussed.},

Available data were limited, with no information on mature planted stands or thinning treatments. A parsimonious model design, incorporating knowledge of stand dynamics and experience from other forests, made possible a logical reproduction of observed behavior and plausible extrapolations to other conditions. Scube consists of a system of four differential equations, describing the evolution of four state variables: top height, trees per hectare, basal area, and a stand closure indicator. Concepts of closure and site occupancy drive the behavior of young stands and the response to thinning. Parameters were estimated through numerical optimization of several residual functions, reflecting different projection interval types and weighting strategies. Differences in estimates among the various criteria were small. Calculations are facilitated through expressions that remain invariant in the absence of disturbances. The methods generalize the algebraic difference approach and related forest modeling techniques, linking them to standard dynamical systems theory. FOR. SCI. 57(4):265-280.},

The estimation used permanent sample plot data from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, supplemented by published site index and young stand information. An ingrowth imputation procedure was devised to facilitate the use of plot measurements where small trees are not measured. Two published site index models were closely approximated by a simple age-base invariant equation. Good parameter estimates for mortality and basal area growth were obtained without using age observations, which were unreliable or missing. Four differential equations describe the dynamics of top height, trees per hectare, basal area, and a site occupancy factor. Current values of these variables are used to estimate total and merchantable volumes up to any diameter limit and diameter distribution parameters. When an independent source of site quality estimates is available, the final model does not require stand age knowledge for making growth and yield predictions.},

  abstract = {We analyzed tree rings over the past 100 years to understand the response of Quercus ilex L to climate change at four different sites along a temperature gradient in a highly anthropogenically transformed ecosystem. To test the hypothesis of a climate change related decrease in productivity at warmer sites, we discuss the effect of historical management on the growth of forest stands and the spatio-temporal variability of growth in response to climate, analyzing departures from linearity in that relationship. We reconstructed stand history and investigated past growth trends using tree-rings. Then we used a dendroecological approach to study the regional, local and age-dependent response to climate, analyzing the relationship between precipitation and tree growth using non-linear mixed models. Tree rings reflected the origin of the studied landscape, mainly a simplification of an original closed forest and progressive canopy opening for agrosilvopastoral purposes after the mid 1800s. As expected, trees were principally responding to water availability, and regional growth (as expressed by the first principal component from the matrix of chronologies) was highly responsive to hydrological year precipitation (r = 0.7). In this water limited ecosystem, the response of growth to precipitation was asymptotic and independent of age, but variable in time. Maximum growth was variable at the different sites and the non-linear function of growth saturated (i.e. reached an asymptote) at temperature dependent site specific precipitation levels within the range considered in the region to lead a shift towards deciduous species dominated woodlands (around 600 mm, variable with mean temperature). Only trees at warmer sites showed symptoms of growth decline, most likely explained by water stress increase in the last decades affecting the highly transformed open (i.e. low competition) tree structure. Stands at colder locations did not show any negative growth trend and may benefit from the current increase in winter temperatures. Coinciding with the decrease in productivity, trees at warmer sites responded more to moisture availability, exhibited a slower response to precipitation and reached maximum growth at higher precipitation levels than trees at colder sites. This suggests that warmer stands are threatened by climate change. The non-linear response of growth to precipitation described is meaningful for different ecological applications and provides new insights in the way trees respond to climate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

(holm oak), and discuss the species climate-growth relationships and the influence of stand density on tree sensitivity to climate. Similarly to Quercus suber L., the most influential climatic variables upon holm oak growth were late spring and early summer precipitation, which enhanced growth, and high temperatures in the previous August and current July, which negatively affected growth. High density stands responded to similar climatic factors as low density stands, but their response was generally weaker. Holm oak sensitivity to climate has increased in recent decades, which might be related to increasing temperatures in the region. Sensitivity was higher in low density stands. Additionally, the effect of summer stress on growth seems to have increased during the same period, similarly to other species in the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting that trees are more vulnerable to climatic changes. Stand density could buffer the response to climate by smoothing climatic extremes. Nevertheless, the effect of competition might reverse this positive effect at the individual tree level. Precautions should be taken before providing management guidelines regarding the effect of climate change and stand density on holm oak.},

  abstract = {Abstract Predicted intense and prolonged drought events challenge forest management. Thinning is debated as a silvicultural measure for reducing drought risk in densely established forest stands. We report on a thinning experiment in a 26-year-old Norway spruce stand (Picea abies), comprising of two thinning intensities and one unthinnned control. The removal of 43% (moderate thinning, MT) and 67% (heavy thinning, HT) of the initial basal area led to increased water availability during the entire three year observation period. Stand-level transpiration (Es) was decreased by about 25% upon moderate, and by about 50% upon heavy thinning during the first year after the interventions had been carried out. However, differences in Es across the treatments decreased within three years after thinning mainly due to increased single-tree transpiration and additional understory evapotranspiration at HT. Nevertheless, due to lower interception and transpiration on the thinned plots three years after treatment MT and HT still showed a substantial surplus in extractable soil water. The results showed that the main determinants concerning the extent of the mitigation effect with increasing thinning intensity were the available soil water storage capacity and the emerging understory vegetation. We conclude that repeated moderate thinning, through enhancing the water availability to the remaining trees, can mitigate drought risk in young spruce stands and thus, represent a viable silvicultural measure in anticipating possible water limitations due to climate change.},

Under continuous nutrient regimes: (1) high-nutrient-grown plants of both species grew faster and had a lower root:shoot ratio than low-nutrient-grown plants, consistent with optimal partitioning theory; (2) both species exhibited a substantial amount of ontogenetic drift as root:shoot ratios decreased through ontogeny (subsequent to an initial increase in R/S shortly after germination); (3) allometric analyses revealed that increased allocation to roots occurred very early in ontogeny for both species, after which the relative growth of shoots exceeded that of roots in low-nutrient-grown plants compared to their high nutrient-grown counterparts - a result inconsistent with optimal partitioning theory. 3. Under temporally varying nutrient regimes: (1) growth substantially increased in low-nutrient-grown plants that were switched to a high-nutrient environment without a change in root:shoot partitioning; (2) there was no change in growth or partitioning when plants were switched from a high- to a low-nutrient regime. 4. We conclude that, for these annual species, root/shoot partitioning is partially consistent with optimal partitioning theory but that is also highly ontogenetically constrained. This constraint is evident both in substantive ontogenetic drift in partitioning and in the period during development that plasticity in partitioning can be expressed.},

  abstract = {Two types of physiological mechanisms can contribute to growth decline with age: (i) the mechanisms leading to the reduction of carbon assimilation (input) and (ii) those leading to modification of the resource economy. Surprisingly, the processes relating to carbon allocation have been little investigated as compared to research on the processes governing carbon assimilation. The objective of this paper was thus to test the hypothesis that growth decrease related to age is accompanied by changes in carbon allocation to the benefit of storage and reproductive functions in two contrasting broad-leaved species: beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). Age-related changes in carbon allocation were studied using a chronosequence approach. Chronosequences, each consisting of several even-aged stands ranging from 14 to 175 years old for beech and from 30 to 134 years old for sessile oak, were divided into five or six age classes. In this study, carbon allocations to growth, storage and reproduction were defined as the relative amount of carbon invested in biomass increment, carbohydrate increment and seed production, respectively. Tree-ring width and allometric relationships were used to assess biomass increment at the tree and stand scales. Below-ground biomass was assessed using a specific allometric relationship between root:shoot ratio and age, established from the literature review. Seasonal variations of carbohydrate concentrations were used to assess carbon allocation to storage. Reproduction effort was quantified for beech stands by collecting seed and cupule production. Age-related flagging of biomass productivity was assessed at the tree and stand scales, and carbohydrate quantities in trees increased with age for both species. Seed and cupule production increased with stand age in beech from 56 gC m−2 year−1 at 30 years old to 129 gC m−2 year−1 at 138 years old. In beech, carbon allocation to storage and reproductive functions increased with age to the detriment of carbon allocation to growth functions. In contrast, the carbon balance between growth and storage remained constant between age classes in sessile oak. The contrasting age-related changes in carbon allocation between beech and sessile oak are discussed with reference to the differences in growing environment, phenology and hydraulic properties of ring-porous and diffuse-porous species.},

  abstract = {The impact of 2 X CO2 driven climate change on radial growth of boreal tree species Pinus banksiana Lamb., Populus tremuloides Michx. and Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP growing in the Duck Mountain Provincial Forest of Manitoba (DMPF), Canada, is simulated using empirical and process-based model approaches. First, empirical relationships between growth and climate are developed. Stepwise multiple-regression models are conducted between tree-ring growth increments (TRGI) and monthly drought, precipitation and temperature series. Predictive skills are tested using a calibration-verification scheme. The established relationships are then transferred to climates driven by 1x and 2 x CO2 scenarios using outputs from the Canadian second-generation coupled global climate model. Second, empirical results are contrasted with process-based projections of net primary productivity allocated to stem development (NPPs). At the finest scale, a leaf-level model of photosynthesis is used to simulate canopy properties per species and their interaction with the variability in radiation, temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Then, a top-down plot-level model of forest productivity is used to simulate landscape-level productivity by capturing the between-stand variability in forest cover. Results show that the predicted TRGI from the empirical models account for up to 56.3% of the variance in the observed TRGI over the period 1912-1999. Under a 2 x CO2 scenario, the predicted impact of climate change is a radial growth decline for all three species under study. However, projections obtained from the process-based model suggest that an increasing growing season length in a changing climate could counteract and potentially overwhelm the negative influence of increased drought stress. The divergence between TRGI and NPPs simulations likely resulted, among others, from assumptions about soil water holding capacity and from calibration of variables affecting gross primary productivity. An attempt was therefore made to bridge the gap between the two modelling approaches by using physiological variables as TRGI predictors. Results obtained in this manner are similar to those obtained using climate variables, and suggest that the positive effect of increasing growing season length would be counteracted by increasing summer temperatures. Notwithstanding uncertainties in these simulations (CO2 fertilization effect, feedback from disturbance regimes, phenology of species, and uncertainties in future CO2 emissions), a decrease in forest productivity with climate change should be considered as a plausible scenario in sustainable forest management planning of the DMPF.

  abstract = {Lichen-spruce woodlands occur in the closed-crown forest zone as a divergent type of the spruce-moss forest because of regeneration failure caused by compounded disturbances (fire, insect outbreaks, and logging). From the southern limit of distribution of lichen woodlands (47 degrees 30' N) to the northern limit of the closed-crown forest zone (52 degrees 40' N), 53 lichen woodlands were sampled for a detailed dendroecological analysis. Radial, height, and volumetric growth of black spruce (Picea mariana) trees among the woodlands varied significantly according to stand age. Growth rates were similar for all even-aged spruce trees, whereas growth rates of trees < 100 y old were significantly greater than those of trees > 100 y old. No significant differences were found in growth rates of spruces distributed along the latitudinal gradient. Spruce trees were generally small in all the woodlands studied, with only a few trees taller than 12 m. Although spruce budworm may have affected all stands, the timing and intensity of the infestations were not necessarily synchronous among the studied stands. Partial least square response (PLS) functions were calculated to evaluate the impact of climate on tree-rings with latitude. Along the 600-km transect, PLS response functions indicated that growth was strongly influenced by current and previous year climatic conditions, particularly precipitation.},

  abstract = {Although optimal foraging theory applied to plant expenditure on resource uptake predicts that plant morphology and physiology should be adjusted to make all resources simultaneously limiting, two considerations make it unlikely that resource enrichment experiments will show strong responses to all nutrient additions. First, growth response to enrichment is strongly dependent on costs and demand, and detectable growth responses are only likely for "expensive" resources in high demand. Second, many resources are acquired simultaneously as a result of allocation to a single structure (e.g., various soil resources obtained by roots). This can cause the growth of an optimally foraging plant to be limited by a single resource. Altering the model to allow for more than one allocation currency (such as nitrogen and carbon) has the effect of making plant composition (and therefore demand) dependent on the supply rates of resources. This assumption can sometimes qualitatively change the above predictions, but the biological relevance of such cases is unclear. We conclude that in addition to supply and demand, the pattern of signs (positive or negative) of net correlations in uptake allocation will control the pattern of multiple limitation. Results of enrichment experiments showing limitation by only a single resource do not necessarily refute the perspective of optimal foraging.},

  abstract = {Modeling height in the context of site index involves two processes: (i) estimating height at base age (site index), given height at some other age, and (ii) estimating height at some desired age given height at base age. When these two processes are modeled by individual functions for each process, height is assumed to be measured without error when on the right-hand side of the equation, but possessing error when on the left-hand side of the equation. This assumption causes a bias in the parameters of the site index curves. The bias in the estimated parameters is evident in the magnitude of the curves and in the shape of the curves, the typical change of shape of the curves from low site index to high site index is underestimated. An ad hoc method is presented that solves the problem. The ad hoc method is conceptually related to methods used in linear regression and to maximum likelihood estimation in a measurement errors problem context. A general measurement errors model is presented as an alternative. The measurement errors model requires an independent estimate of measurement error.},

  abstract = {Background: Growth rate management in fast-growing bacteria is currently an active research area. In spite of the huge progress made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the growth rate, fundamental questions concerning its intrinsic limitations are still relevant today. In parallel, systems biology claims that mathematical models could shed light on these questions. Methods: This review explores some possible reasons for the limitation of the growth rate in fast-growing bacteria, using a systems biology approach based on constraint-based modeling methods. Results: Recent experimental results and a new constraint-based modelling method named Resource Balance Analysis (RBA) reveal the existence of constraints on resource allocation between biological processes in bacterial cells. In this context, the distribution of a finite amount of resources between the metabolic network and the ribosomes limits the growth rate, which implies the existence of a bottleneck between these two processes. Any mechanism for saving resources increases the growth rate. General Significance: Consequently, the emergence of genetic regulation of metabolic pathways, e.g. catabolite repression, could then arise as a means to minimise the protein cost, i.e. maximising growth performance while minimising the resource allocation.

  abstract = {Many species of non-flying mammal depend on tree hollows (cavities or holes) for shelter and survival. I reviewed the published literature on tree hollow use by Australian non-flying arboreal and scansorial mammals to provide a synthesis of tree hollow requirements, to identify gaps in knowledge and to stimulate future research that may improve the management of these species. The use of hollows was described in some detail for 18 of 42 hollow-using species. Most information was for possums and gliding possums, whereas dasyurid marsupials and rodents were largely neglected. The paucity of data for many species must be addressed because it represents an impediment to their conservation. Hollow abundance appears to be the primary determinant of tree preferences. This accounts for the frequent use of standing dead trees by most species. Most hollow-bearing trees used as dens were at least 100 years of age. Further studies that describe the dynamic processes that govern the availability of tree hollows are needed. The few studies that document attrition of hollow-bearing trees suggest that land managers need to improve strategies for the effective retention and long-term replacement of these trees.},

  abstract = {Changes in the composition of a community due to the invasion by exotic plant species can lead to modi. cation of ecosystem function that, in turn, produces feedbacks that drive further changes in community composition. The development of predictive models of this process requires an understanding of the spatial extent of the impacts of the exotic species, particularly during early stages of invasion. The main objective of this study was to characterize the neighborhood dynamics of ecosystem transformations by the invasive tree species Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) and tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima Mill.) in temperate forests of the northeastern United States. By using a neighborhood approach in multiple sites, we sought to determine (1) the magnitude and spatial extent of the effects of the two invasive species on soil properties and processes; (2) whether the effects of the invasive species were site dependent; and (3) the differences in the effects of invasive versus native tree species on ecosystem processes. Our results showed that Norway maple and tree of heaven alter the functioning of temperate forest ecosystems even at relatively low densities by increasing cycling rates (i.e., net N mineralization, net nitrification, Ca mineralization) and nutrient availability (i.e., pH, Ca, Mg, K, N). At the neighborhood scale, the spatial extent of the impact of the two species varied strikingly among soil properties. Moreover, the neighborhood effects of the two invasive species were site dependent, with the magnitude of the impact increasing with soil fertility. At the community level, Norway maple and to a lesser extent tree of heaven had stronger effect on soils than any of the dominant native tree species considered. We conclude that the invasion of northeastern forests by Norway maple and tree of heaven is characterized by predictable, neighborhood-specific acceleration of nutrient cycling rates and localized increases in nutrient pools. These ecosystem alterations have enormous potential for the modi. cation of competitive hierarchies in forest communities. In particular, Norway maple and tree of heaven may change relative abundances within the native community to the benefit of native species that are more competitive on nutrient rich sites.},

  abstract = {1. Effects of invasive species on ecosystem processes are often thought to underlie the effects of invaders on community dynamics. Specifically, positive feedbacks in which invasive species alter ecosystem function in ways that favour their own growth have been suggested as an important mechanism contributing to the success of invasion. 2. In this study, we analysed the impacts of the invasive exotic tree Acer platanoides on survival and growth of conspecific and native tree seedlings, and explored whether these impacts can be explained by the ecosystem effects of the invader. Seedlings of Acer platanoides, Acer saccharum, Fraxinus americana and Prunus serotina were monitored in quadrats in three forest stands in northwestern Connecticut. Soil resources and light levels were quantified in the same quadrats. 3. Maximum-likelihood methods were used to predict seedling survival and growth as a function of the size and spatial configuration of A. platanoides trees in the immediate neighbourhood (0-25 m). 4. The abundance of A. platanoides in the neighbourhood had moderate negative effects on survival of first-year conspecific seedlings, but did not affect survival of older conspecific or native seedlings. These negative effects on conspecifics were not correlated with soil nutrients or light levels, but were presumably related to Janzen-Connell effects. In contrast, A. platanoides had strong positive effects on the growth of seedlings of all four species. These positive effects appear to be related to the positive impacts of the invader on soil fertility. 5. Our results support the importance of canopy-seedling feedbacks as a mechanism regulating the rate of invasion in forests. However, they also indicate that the net consequences of feedbacks on the process of invasion are probably determined by the balance of positive and negative feedbacks acting at the same time on different aspects of regeneration (i.e. survival vs. growth). 6. Synthesis. Because the species with the highest inherent growth rates were the most responsive to the 'fertilizing' effect of A. platanoides, we conclude that the invasion of north-eastern forests by this exotic tree may facilitate canopy dominance by fast-growing native and exotic species associated with fertile soils.},

  abstract = {Most large-scale multispecies studies of tree growth have been conducted in tropical and cool temperate forests, whereas Mediterranean water-limited ecosystems have received much less attention. This limits our understanding of how growth of coexisting tree species varies along environmental gradients in these forests, and the implications for species interactions and community assembly under current and future climatic conditions. Here, we quantify the absolute effect and relative importance of climate, tree size and competition as determinants of tree growth patterns in Iberian forests, and explore interspecific differences in the two components of competitive ability (competitive response and effect) along climatic and size gradients. Spatially explicit neighborhood models were developed to predict tree growth for the 15 most abundant Iberian tree species using permanent-plot data from the Spanish Second and Third National Forest Inventory (IFN). Our neighborhood analyses showed a climatic and size effect on tree growth, but also revealed that competition from neighbors has a comparatively much larger impact on growth in Iberian forests. Moreover, the sensitivity to competition (i.e. competitive response) of target trees varied markedly along climatic gradients causing significant rank reversals in species performance, particularly under xeric conditions. We also found compelling evidence for strong species-specific competitive effects in these forests. Altogether, these results constitute critical new information which not only furthers our understanding of important theoretical questions about the assembly of Mediterranean forests, but will also be of help in developing new guidelines for adapting forests in this climatic boundary to global change. If we consider the climatic gradients of this study as a surrogate for future climatic conditions, then we should expect absolute growth rates to decrease and sensitivity to competition to increase in most forests of the Iberian Peninsula (in all but the northern Atlantic forests), making these management considerations even more important in the future.},

  abstract = {The "Law of the Minimum" states that growth is controlled by the scarcest resource (limiting factor). This concept was originally applied to plant or crop growth (Justus von Liebig, 1840, Salisbury, Plant physiology, 4th edn., Wadsworth, Belmont, 1992) and quantitatively supported by many experiments. Some generalizations based on more complicated "dose-response" curves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental ecosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of similar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation of Liebig's law follows from adaptation effects. If the fitness of an organism in a fixed environment satisfies the Law of the Minimum then adaptation equalizes the pressure of essential factors and, therefore, acts against the Liebig's law. This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly chosen pair "organism-environment" the Law of the Minimum typically holds, then in a well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law. For the opposite interaction of factors (a synergistic system of factors which amplify each other), adaptation leads from factor equivalence to limitations by a smaller number of factors. For analysis of adaptation, we develop a system of models based on Selye's idea of the universal adaptation resource (adaptation energy). These models predict that under the load of an environmental factor a population separates into two groups (phases): a less correlated, well adapted group and a highly correlated group with a larger variance of attributes, which experiences problems with adaptation. Some empirical data are presented and evidences of interdisciplinary applications to econometrics are discussed.},

Recent empirical and modeling studies reveal that mechanisms (2) and (3) are largely responsible for age-related decline in ANPP for forests in cold environments. Increasing respiratory costs appear to be relatively unimportant in explaining declining productivity in ageing stands.},

Estimation of the total water flow with sap flowmeters, HPV and water absorption yielded comparable results. We concluded from dye colorations, thermograms and axial profiles of sap flow and heat pulse velocity that, in intact trunks, most of the flow occurred in the current-year ring, where early-wood vessels in the outermost ring were still functional. Nevertheless, there was significant flow in the older rings of the xylem. Total water flow through the trunk was only slightly reduced when air embolisms were artificially induced in early-wood vessels, probably because there was little change in hydraulic conductance in the root–leaf sap pathway. Embolization of the current-year vessels reactivated transport in the older rings.},

  abstract = {Effective adaptation of forest management practices to climate change will require a good understanding of the ecological and climatic factors influencing tree sensitivities and responses to climate. Using tree-ring data collected from 33 stands of mature interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) spanning a wide climatic range in British Columbia (BC), Canada, we present an approach combining high-resolution spatiotemporal climate data with traditional dendroecological analyses to quantify relationships between population climate-growth sensitivity and provenance (i.e., seed-source origin) climate. Key results showed that Douglas-fir climate-growth sensitivities were strongly linked to provenance climate and varied in coherent patterns across climatic gradients. Climate-growth sensitivities and responses were sometimes opposite between provenances from disparate climates. Perhaps most importantly, our results showed that Douglas-fir productivity across most of its range was sensitive to moisture limitations, and this sensitivity increased strongly with decreasing provenance mean annual precipitation and increasing heat-moisture index. Using geographic information systems, we visualize the link between provenance mean annual precipitation and climatic sensitivity of Douglas-fir across BC to identify "high risk" populations.

  abstract = {We present an inventory and analysis of discussions of ecological stability, considering 163 definitions of 70 different stability concepts. Our aim is to derive a strategy that can help to dispel the existing ''confusion of tongues'' on the subject of ''stability'' and prevent its future recurrence. The strategy consists of three questions that should be kept in mind when communicating about stability properties. These three questions should overcome the three main sources of confusion in terminology. Firstly, which stability properties are being addressed in the stability statement? Our analysis shows that the general term ''stability'' is so ambiguous as to be useless. It can be replaced by the stability properties ''staying essentially unchanged'' (constancy), ''returning to the reference state (or dynamic) after a temporary disturbance'' (resilience), and ''persistence through time of an ecological system'' (persistence). Second, to what ecological situation does the statement refer? An ecological situation is defined by a set of features that, taken as a whole, determine the domain of validity of a stability statement. The six most important features form the ''ecological checklist'', which serves to classify ecological situations and thereby provides a system of coordinates for communication. The six points are: variable of interest, level of description, reference state, disturbance, spatial scale and temporal scale. Thirdly, is the statement anchored in the situation in question, or is there unacceptable generalisation by inferring ''stability'' of the whole system from a certain stability property in a certain ecological ecological situation? This question separates the scientifically valuable content of a statement from the desire for general statements which is often projected through stability statements.},

  abstract = {Climate models predict an increase in the intensity and frequency of drought episodes in the Northern Hemisphere. Among terrestrial ecosystems, forests will be profoundly impacted by drier climatic conditions, with drastic consequences for the functions and services they supply. Simultaneously, biodiversity is known to support a wide range of forest ecosystem functions and services. However, whether biodiversity also improves the resistance of these ecosystems to drought remains unclear. We compared soil drought exposure levels in a total of 160 forest stands within five major forest types across Europe along a gradient of tree species diversity. We assessed soil drought exposure in each forest stand by calculating the stand-level increase in carbon isotope composition of late wood from a wet to a dry year (Δδ13CS). Δδ13CS exhibited a negative linear relationship with tree species diversity in two forest types, suggesting that species interactions in these forests diminished the drought exposure of the ecosystem. However, the other three forest types were unaffected by tree species diversity. We conclude that higher diversity enhances resistance to drought events only in drought-prone environments. Managing forest ecosystems for high tree species diversity does not necessarily assure improved adaptability to the more severe and frequent drought events predicted for the future.},

  abstract = {Growth and its relationship with recent competitive performance of Norway spruce and European beech were investigated in semi-natural mixed forests in southern Sweden. Dendroclimatological methods revealed the main influencing climate variables. The radial growth of beech is mainly determined by the late summer conditions from the previous year. The July temperature has become increasingly more important since the 1950s and even more significant since the 1990s. Before the 1950s, the main factor for spruce growth was the summer precipitation. This influence has nearly vanished, and the spruce trees react more distinctly to temperature of the previous summer. This shift in the climate signal indicates a sensitive response of spruce growth to changed conditions and points to a distinctly increased sensitiveness of spruce under future conditions. The competition interactions between mainly dominating spruce and mostly subordinate beech are already changing. European beech growth potential could benefit from warm summers and prolonged vegetation periods and increase its mean diameter in relation to spruce. In contrast, Norway spruce is more threatened by increased abiotic and biotic disturbances. The higher competitive vigour and changed vitality of beech and the lower vitality of spruce may alter the distribution boundaries of both species in Sweden.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The structure of a forest stand, i.e. the distribution of tree size features, has strong effects on its functioning. The management of the structure is therefore an important tool in mitigating the impact of predicted changes in climate on forests, especially with respect to drought. Here, a new functional–structural model is presented and is used to assess the effects of management on forest functioning at a national scale.Methods The stand process-based model (PBM) Castanea was coupled to a stand structure module (SSM) based on empirical tree-to-tree competition rules. The calibration of the SSM was based on a thorough analysis of intersite and interannual variability of competition asymmetry. The coupled Castanea–SSM model was evaluated across France using forest inventory data, and used to compare the effect of contrasted silvicultural practices on simulated stand carbon fluxes and growth.Key Results The asymmetry of competition varied consistently with stand productivity at both spatial and temporal scales. The modelling of the competition rules enabled efficient prediction of changes in stand structure within the Castanea PBM. The coupled model predicted an increase in net primary productivity (NPP) with management intensity, resulting in higher growth. This positive effect of management was found to vary at a national scale across France: the highest increases in NPP were attained in forests facing moderate to high water stress; however, the absolute effect of management on simulated stand growth remained moderate to low because stand thinning involved changes in carbon allocation at the tree scale.Conclusions This modelling approach helps to identify the areas where management efforts should be concentrated in order to mitigate near-future drought impact on national forest productivity. Around a quarter of the French temperate oak and beech forests are currently in zones of high vulnerability, where management could thus mitigate the influence of climate change on forest yield},

  abstract = {In 1973, C. S. Holling introduced the word resilience into the ecological literature as a way of helping to understand the non-linear dynamics observed in ecosystems. Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

The oak-pine stand is typical for the ongoing forest transformation in the north-eastern lowlands. The pine and the oak trees are 104 and 9 years old, respectively. Three different management scenarios (A, B, C) with different thinning grades and a thinning interval of five years were simulated. Every management scenario was simulated under three different climate scenarios (OK, 2K, 3K) compiled by the regional statistical climate model STAR 2.0 (PIK). For each climate scenario 100 different realisations were generated. The realisations of the climate scenarios encompass the period 2036-2060 and exhibit an increase of mean annual temperature of zero, two and three Kelvin until 2060, respectively. We selected 9 model outputs concerning biomass, growth and harvest which were aggregated to a single total performance index (TPI). The TPI was used to assess the management scenarios with regard to three management objectives (carbon sequestration, intermediate, timber yield) under climate change until 2060. We found out that management scenario A led to the highest TPI concerning the carbon sequestration objective and management scenario C performed best concerning the two other objectives. The analysis of variance in the growth related model outputs showed an increase of climate uncertainty with increasing climate warming. Interestingly, the increase of climate induced uncertainty is much higher from 2 to 3 K than from 0 to 2 K.},

  abstract = {Various approaches have been developed to achieve sustainability in forestry, under changing social needs and, consequently, changing definitions of sustainability. This has led to the confusing situation in which various groups have different understandings of the meaning of 'sustainability'. Likewise, the concepts utilized to achieve sustainability, often with a poorly defined objective, are sometimes not clear and/or inconsistent as a systematic overview regarding definitions and concepts is lacking. Based on a literature review, this paper discusses related terms such as sustainability, sustained yield management, sustainable forestry, sustainable forest management and sustainable development: their history, concepts and relationships, from a European perspective. Finally, flexibility is proposed as a solution to overcome the identified shortcomings at all scales, while focussing on the enterprise level. The origin of the sustainability concept in forestry was first driven by forest experts, while participatory elements have been considered since the more recent idea of sustainable development. Since then, much effort has been made to achieve intragenerational fairness by creating an improved participatory process. Concurrently, the original idea of sustainable forestry as long-term and future-oriented management, considering future generations' needs fell behind. An increasing standing timber volume in Europe and the discussion on climate change brought new interest in how to cope with risks in the context of pervasive future uncertainties within the scope of promoting sustainable development. Although the consideration of risk has been concentrated on as a topic in forest science in recent years, studies have mainly focused on the enhancement of forest resistance against disturbances. However, precaution and risk avoidance alone are probably insufficient to achieve an improved sustainable development that focuses on intergenerational fairness, as these more defensive approaches may disregard important management opportunities involved with an uncertain future. A perhaps more promising approach, the idea of future options and the ability to respond to changing social and biophysical circumstances (i.e. flexibility) as criteria for sustainable development have only shown a shadowy existence up to now. To further develop the consistency of sustainability concepts, a shift of sustainability approaches from continuity towards flexibility options is proposed.},

By investigating the xylem anatomy of branches and coarse roots, and measuring branch axial hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation in 4-year-old field-grown aspen plants of five demes (Populus tremula L. and Populus tremuloides Michx.) differing in growth rate, we tested the hypotheses that (i) demes differ in wood anatomical and hydraulic properties, (ii) hydraulic efficiency and safety are related to xylem anatomical traits, and (iii) aboveground productivity and hydraulic efficiency are negatively correlated to cavitation resistance. Significant deme differences existed in seven of the nine investigated branch-related anatomical and hydraulic traits but only in one of the four coarse-root-related anatomical traits; this likely is a consequence of high intra-plant variation in root morphology and the occurrence of a few ‘high-conductivity roots’. Growth rate was positively related to branch hydraulic efficiency (xylem-specific conductivity) but not to cavitation resistance; this indicates that no marked trade-off exists between cavitation resistance and growth. Both branch hydraulic safety and hydraulic efficiency significantly depended on vessel size and were related to the genetic distance between the demes, while the xylem pressure causing 88% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P88 value) was more closely related to hydraulic efficiency than the commonly used P50 value. Deme-specific variation in the pit membrane structure may explain why vessel size was not directly linked to growth rate. We conclude that branch hydraulic efficiency is an important growth-influencing trait in aspen, while the assumed trade-off between productivity and hydraulic safety is weak.},

  abstract = {The changing emphasis within British forestry from a clearfell/replant system focussed on timber production, to multipurpose forestry encompassing biodiversity and recreation, has resulted in a need for changes to forest management. Manipulation of the forest canopy through thinnings is a powerful tool for forest managers to modify the canopy transmittance, and therefore the below-canopy light levels. This helps to achieve specific objectives such as habitat management or seedling growth as part of transformation of an even-aged stand to a continuous cover forestry regime. In this study, hemispherical photography was used to assess canopy transmittance in a range of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in Britain. Species-specific relationships were developed between canopy transmittance and easily-measured stand parameters. The models that provided the best fit to the data were based on basal area and stocking for Sitka spruce and basal area alone for Scots pine. The models indicate that a Sitka spruce stand with a basal area of 30 m2 ha−1 should have a stocking density <450 stems ha−1 to favour growth of Sitka spruce seedlings. Similarly, a Scots pine stand should have a basal area <27 m2 ha−1 to achieve transmittance suitable for growth of Scots pine seedlings. In conjunction with a knowledge of the light requirements of different vegetation types, these models can provide a valuable contribution to guidance on current and changing forest management practice.},

  abstract = {A spatially explicit, reiterative algorithm (SERA) is presented and used to predict multiple aspects of plant population and community dynamics. Using simple physical principles and empirically derived relationships, SERA provides an analytical venue to test alternative hypotheses about individual functional traits governing ecological or evolutionary processes at the population or community level of complexity. Our analyses show that, as a result of competition for light and space, individual-level features scale up to produce species ensemble properties such as the scaling of self-thinning, size-dependent mortality, realistic size-frequency distributions, and a broad spectrum of empirically observed relationships for the species examined. SERA also predicts the competitive exclusion of conifers by angiosperms and the age at which reproductive maturity is achieved by different species. SERA serves as a null hypothesis by demonstrating that biologically complex phenomena, including widely observed scaling relationships at the species-ensemble level, can emerge from the operation of simple and transparent "rules" governing competition for space and light.},

  abstract = { Competition between individual plants is defined as a mathematical function for the mean growth rate of individuals in a vertically mono-layered crowded stand as compared with growth of an isolated individual of the same size. The degree of competitive asymmetry can be described mathematically by using this definition. A canopy photosynthesis model for individual growth in a mono-layered stand shows that physiological and environmental variations have little effects on the size-structure dynamics of plant populations undergoing strongly asymmetric competition. These variations affect greatly the size-structure dynamics under symmetric competition. It has also been shown that one-sided competition (the most asymmetric competition) is never realised in a mono-layered stand. A spatial competition model shows that variation in the spatial distribution pattern of individuals greatly affects the size-structure dynamics of populations undergoing symmetric competition, whilst it has little effect on populations undergoing strongly asymmetric competition. Therefore, it can be concluded that a population undergoing strongly asymmetric competition is a stable system little affected by variations in various factors and that a population undergoing symmetric competition is an unstable system greatly affected by these variations.

Based on these theoretical results, the relationships between the mode of competition, species diversity and community stability are discussed and a hypothesis on these processes and mechanisms is proposed for grassland and forest plant communities. One-sided competition is associated with the stability of community structure, and this type of competition works as a structuring force for plant communities. Symmetric competition is associated with species diversity, and this type of competition cannot be a structuring force of plant communities, i.e. symmetric competition is irrelevant to the deterministic community dynamics. Distinctly multi-layered forests show “apparent” one-sided competition between layers (i.e. little direct interactions between canopies in different layers, but higher-layer trees suppress lower-layer trees one-sidedly), bringing about structural stability, but trees in each layer undergo symmetric competition, bringing about species diversity. Mono-layered grassland shows symmetric competition, bringing about small-scale spatio-temporal changes in species' abundance and hence species diversity. The real world lies between the two extreme types of competition, one-sided and completely symmetric, and each plant community has its own position in this continuous spectrum of the competition mode.},

Patterns of stand growth and development were examined and compared with yield model estimates of stand characteristics of plantations of the same initial spacings, ages, and site index in the southeastern United States. The Hawaiian plantings had much higher survival at all spacings and sustained high diameter growth in the face of intense competition. At Age 34, the 1.8 m spacing had 1585 stems/ha averaging 24.1 m tall and 28.8 cm DBH; the widest spacing (3.7 m) had 725 stems/ha, 26.1 m tall and 38.2 cm DBH. The highest basal areas (∼100 m2/ha) were double maxima attained in the southeastern United States and were reflected in similar differences in volume yields. The Hawaiian plantings demonstrate that growth potential of loblolly pine is far greater than is apparent from observations on plantations in its native habitat. To capture this potential in other situations, research must identify the tree, stand, and environmental characteristics associated with low mortality rates and high diameter growth in Hawaii, and, conversely, the factors that limit loblolly's potential in the southeastern United States.},

  abstract = {Synergistic interactions between multiple limiting resources are common, highlighting the importance of co-limitation as a constraint on primary production. Our concept of resource limitation has shifted over the past two decades from an earlier paradigm of single-resource limitation towards concepts of co-limitation by multiple resources, which are predicted by various theories. Herein, we summarise multiple-resource limitation responses in plant communities using a dataset of 641 studies that applied factorial addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in freshwater, marine and terrestrial systems. We found that more than half of the studies displayed some type of synergistic response to N and P addition. We found support for strict definitions of co-limitation in 28% of the studies: i.e. community biomass responded to only combined N and P addition, or to both N and P when added separately. Our results highlight the importance of interactions between N and P in regulating primary producer community biomass and point to the need for future studies that address the multiple mechanisms that could lead to different types of co-limitation.},

  abstract = {Growth and mortality of coast Douglas-fir(Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) were studied for 25 years after planting seedlings at 1-6-m spacings on a site of moderate quality in the western Cascade Mountains of Washington. Responses were compared to those from two other studies representing high and low site qualities. Third-year height did not differ among spacings (P = 0.80), providing no evidence that close spacing stimulated early growth. Piecewise regression identified the onset of competition-induced mortality when stand density index (SDI [Reineke, L.H. 1933. Perfecting a stand density index for even-aged forests Journal of Agricultural Research 46, 627-638]) exceeded 52% (S.E. = 4.6) of the species' maximum or when average crown ratio (CR) declined below 52% (S.E. = 0.9). For a range of SDI values, CR averaged 2-7% points greater at the high-quality site than at the moderate-quality site. In a regression analysis of combined data from the moderate- and high-quality sites, relative values of average stem diameter and stand volume (% of maximum values observed per site) 23-25 years after planting increased and decreased with planting spacing, respectively (R(2) = 0.97 and 0.91, respectively). Intersection of these relationships at 3-m spacing indicated a point of equivalent relative development of tree size and stand yield. For a range of site qualities, stands planted at 3-m spacing: (1) maintained tree vigor (CR >= 50%) and stability (average height:dbh ratio <90), (2) experienced little or no competition-induced mortality through age 25 years, and (3) allocated 25-year growth equitably to development of tree size and stand yield, thereby providing a desirable starting point for subsequent management.

  abstract = {Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can also be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, based on controlling for indirect effects with linear or generalized linear models, also performed well. Indirect effects reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce incorrect inferences, however.},

  abstract = {Overdispersion is common in models of count data in ecology and evolutionary biology, and can occur due to missing covariates, non-independent (aggregated) data, or an excess frequency of zeroes (zero-inflation). Accounting for overdispersion in such models is vital, as failing to do so can lead to biased parameter estimates, and false conclusions regarding hypotheses of interest. Observation-level random effects (OLRE), where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that models the extra-Poisson variation present in the data, are commonly employed to cope with overdispersion in count data. However studies investigating the efficacy of observation-level random effects as a means to deal with overdispersion are scarce. Here I use simulations to show that in cases where overdispersion is caused by random extra-Poisson noise, or aggregation in the count data, observation-level random effects yield more accurate parameter estimates compared to when overdispersion is simply ignored. Conversely, OLRE fail to reduce bias in zero-inflated data, and in some cases increase bias at high levels of overdispersion. There was a positive relationship between the magnitude of overdispersion and the degree of bias in parameter estimates. Critically, the simulations reveal that failing to account for overdispersion in mixed models can erroneously inflate measures of explained variance (r2), which may lead to researchers overestimating the predictive power of variables of interest. This work suggests use of observation-level random effects provides a simple and robust means to account for overdispersion in count data, but also that their ability to minimise bias is not uniform across all types of overdispersion and must be applied judiciously.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study is to investigate crown width, breast height diameter, height to live crown base, and taper rates of trees which were unaffected by inter tree competition throughout their life. Such open-grown trees represent the empirical maximum tree dimensions which have been used for developing management guidelines, modelling competition and crown closure. Using 435 open-grown trees including 11 different tree species from an Austria-wide open-grown tree study, equations were developed for predicting: (1) the crown width, (2) the breast height diameter, (3) the height to live crown base, and (4) the taper rates of such open-grown trees. All developed relationships were tested for possible site variations. The results indicate that except for the breast height diameter-height relationship of stone pine and the taper rates of Norway spruce and larch, site influences can be neglected because they unduly complicate empirical assumptions for a small gain in predictability. Finally, the results of this study make it possible to determine maximum tree dimensions for all tree species in Austria.},

  abstract = {Using 30 years of climate records from 20 weather stations, we investigate the magnitude of temperature and precipitation change, and change in the length of the growing season between 1961 and 1990. Special attention is paid to the period between 1981 and 1990, because recent research suggests that, during this time-span, forest productivity may have increased in the northern latitudes. In order to understand the importance of changes in climate on forest growth, we use the ecosystem model FOREST-BGC as a diagnostic tool to predict the annual net primary production (NPP). The results of our study indicate: no change in precipitation between 1961 and 1990; a significant (alpha = 0.05) increase in mean annual temperature of 0.72 degrees C, mean annual minimum temperature (0.80 degrees C), winter temperature (2.36 degrees C) as well as an increase in the length of the temperature controlled growing season by 11 days, resulting in a significant increase in diameter increment obtained from 1179 cores of Norway spruce across Austria. The trends in NPP are consistent with observed increment rates validating the use of biogeochemical modeling as a diagnostic tool to search for possible causes on changing environmental conditions.

Mean annual streamflow of 585 mm from catchments forested with 30-year-old mountain ash compares with mean annual streamflow of 1195 mm from the same catchments that 27 years previously were forested with old growth mountain ash. About three-quarters of the difference can be explained by a difference in transpiration, and the remainder by a difference in interception loss. Based on earlier observations that differences in transpiration between mountain ash overstoreys aged 50, 90, 150 and 230 years can largely be explained by differences in stand sapwood cross-sectional areas, variation in transpiration with age was accounted for by fitting a log-normal relationship to overstorey sapwood areas measured in six mountain ash stands aged from 7 to 235 years. The sapwood area of the eucalypt overstorey reached a peak of 10.5 m2 ha−1 at about age 15 and then declined gradually to 2.5 m2 ha−1 at age 200. A log-normal relationship fitted to a time series of throughfall measurements from mountain ash forests ranging in age from 1 to 244 years indicates the peak interception loss of 25% to occur at age 30. Interception loss gradually declines to 17% at age 200 years.},

We investigated variations of slope. from the linear branch of the segmented model for oak. We found stand density, species composition, and site index to have a significant influence. The basal area increment of oak decreased with rising admixture of beech and increased with site quality and lower stand density. The effect of beech admixture found in the present study corresponds with findings from tree physiology on below- and aboveground competition.

While both light and soil resources limit growth and influence competitive responses in tropical forests, the effects of belowground resources on allometries are less understood, especially within the understory. To characterize outcomes of tree competition along an edaphic resource gradient, we quantified variation in height and crown allometries of six Bornean tree species from contrasting regeneration niches (light-demanding vs. shade-tolerant) on two soil habitats (clay-fine loam and sandy loam) within a 52-ha forest dynamics plot. Using empirically-fit allometric parameters and diameter growth rates from plot census data, we modeled tree height and crown area growth over the projected life span of each species. Based on resource competition theory, we hypothesized that tree species specializing on and populations of generalist species growing on the relatively moister, more fertile clay-fine loam soil habitat would have faster height and crown growth rates, compared to those on the sandy loam habitat, regardless of regeneration niche. Among soil specialists and within generalists of both genera, trees growing on clay-fine loam had taller stems and larger crowns at a given age and faster height and crown area growth rates at most sizes than trees on sandy loam. Differences in height and crown growth were driven by the faster diameter growth rates of trees on clay-fine loam, not by differences in height- and crown-diameter allometries, as trees on sandy loam were significantly taller at a given diameter, and differences in crown allometry were not consistent across soil habitats. Characterizing the height and crown growth responses of trees along resource gradients provides insight into the mechanisms that maintain diversity in tropical forests. Our results point to the importance of adaptive and plastic responses to both above and belowground resource availability in determining the allometric growth of trees and suggest that this diversity of responses may contribute tree species coexistence through competition-based trade-off mechanisms and variation in growth among individuals. Additionally, as the importance estimating natural carbon sequestration increases with the escalating effects of anthropogenic climate change, differences in tree growth and architecture across soil habitats also have implications for the approximation of forest carbon storage on heterogeneous tropical soils.},

In contrast to traditional variance decomposition, it is thus the unexplained, not the explained, variance that is split. It gives rise to a coefficient of individual determination (CID) defined as the estimated fraction of explained individual variance. We argue that in many applications CID is a valuable complement to R 2 , since it excludes noise variance (which can never be explained) and thus has one as a natural upper bound. A general theory for coefficients determination is presented, including various choices of regression models, weight functions and parameter estimates. In particular we focus on models where CID is computable, such as univariate mixed Poisson and logistic regression models, as well as multivariate mixed linear regression models. Large sample properties and confidence intervals are derived and finally, the theory is exemplified using Poisson regression on a Swedish motor traffic insurance data set.},

However, new geophysical research suggests that dramatic climatic changes during the Late Pleistocene occurred extremely rapid, over just a few years. These abrupt climatic changes may have been even faster than contemporary ones, but relatively few continent-wide extinctions of species have been documented for these periods. This raises questions about the ability of extant species to adapt to ongoing climate change. We propose that the advances in geophysical research challenge current views about species' ability to cope with climate change, and that lessons must be learned for modelling future impacts of climate change on species.},

Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis Database to fit two growth models across the South and apply the four Hadley III climate scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report to project future growth and site productivity on loblolly pine plantations. The static growth model provides a direct test of whether a significant climate influence on forest growth can be statistically derived, while the dynamic growth model estimates climate effects through site productivity. Results indicate considerable spatial variation in potential future growth and productivity change on loblolly pine plantations due to climate change in the southern United States, while overall regional effects are projected to be marginal. The pattern of climate change impacts is consistent across the growth models and climate scenarios. These findings have several implications for climate change adaptation policies.},

  abstract = {. Premise of the study : Climate warming might have resulted in altered initiation and termination dates of stem xylem growth in boreal stands. A systematic understanding of intra-annual xylem formation is thus needed for precise simulation of future growth in the context of sustainable forest management. . Methods : A recently developed novel microsampling approach was employed over two growing seasons (2005-2006) to investigate the intra-annual stem xylem formation of Picea mariana at three sites along a latitudinal gradient (approximately 47.5-5 degrees N) in western Quebec, Canada. The critical timings of xylem cell formation were determined and compared among sites/years. The relationships between xylem cell formation and meteorological variables were examined. . Key results : From south to north, the onset of xylem cell production was detected on 20 May (SD +/- 3) at Angliers, 24 May (SD +/- 3) at Chicobi and 24 May (SD +/- 4) at Muskuchii in 2005, and on 12 May (SD +/- 4) at Angliers, 14 May (SD +/- 3) at Chicobi and 20 May (SD +/- 3) at Muskuchii in 2006, respectively. Xylem cell production at each respective site terminated on 11 August (SD +/- 4), 7 August (SD +/- 3), and 7 August (SD +/- 4) in 2005, and on 8 August (SD +/- 4), 4 August (SD +/- 4), and 4 August (SD +/- 4) in 2006, respectively. . Conclusion : Our study implies that despite the expected occurrence of earlier phenological development due to early spring climate warming, boreal trees like P. mariana might not be producing wider rings if cold temperatures occur later in the growing season in June to August. These results may challenge the view that boreal trees could be benefiting from spring warming to enhance growth.},

  abstract = {In this study we examined various measures, including the concordance correlation (CC) coefficient, for determining the goodness of fit of forest models estimated by nonlinear mixed-model (NLMM) methods. Based on the volume-age data for black spruce, we analyzed the use of CC and other traditional goodness-of-fit measures such as coefficient of determination (R(2)), mean bias, percent bias, root mean square error, and graphic techniques on both the population and subject-specific levels within the NLMM framework. We also examined the relationship between goodness-of-fit measures and the number of observations per subject. We found that the standard overall goodness-of-fit measures commonly reported on combined data from different subjects were generally insufficient in determining the goodness of fitted models. We recommend that CC and other selected goodness-of-fit measures be calculated for individual subjects, and that the frequency distributions of the calculated values be examined and used as the principal criteria for determining the goodness of fit of forest models estimated by NLMM methods and for comparing alternative models and covariance structures. We also emphasized the importance of using pertinent graphic techniques to assess the appropriateness of NLMMs, especially at the subject-specific level, wherein lies the main interest of NLMMs.},

  abstract = {To address the central question of how climate change influences tree growth within the context of global warming, we used dendroclimatological analysis to understand the reactions of four major boreal tree species - Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Picea mariana, and Pinus banksiana - to climatic variations along a broad latitudinal gradient from 46 to 54 degrees N in the eastern Canadian boreal forest. Tree-ring chronologies from 34 forested stands distributed at a 1 degrees interval were built, transformed into principal components (PCs), and analyzed through bootstrapped correlation analysis over the period 1950-2003 to identify climate factors limiting the radial growth and the detailed radial growth-climate association along the gradient. All species taken together, previous summer temperature (negative influences), and current January and March-April temperatures (positive influences) showed the most consistent relationships with radial growth across the gradient. Combined with the identified species/site-specific climate factors, our study suggested that moisture conditions during the year before radial growth played a dominant role in positively regulating P. tremuloides growth, whereas January temperature and growing season moisture conditions positively impacted growth of B. papyrifera. Both P. mariana and P. banksiana were positively affected by the current-year winter and spring or whole growing season temperatures over the entire range of our corridor. Owing to the impacts of different climate factors on growth, these boreal species showed inconsistent responsiveness to recent warming at the transition zone, where B. papyrifera, P. mariana, and P. banksiana would be the most responsive species, whereas P. tremuloides might be the least. Under continued warming, B. papyrifera stands located north of 49 degrees N, P. tremuloides at northern latitudes, and P. mariana and P. banksiana stands located north of 47 degrees N might benefit from warming winter and spring temperatures to enhance their radial growth in the coming decades, whereas other southern stands might be decreasing in radial growth.},

All functions were fitted using weighted nonlinear least squares regression (w(i) = 1/DBH(i)) because of the problem of unequal error variance. The examination and comparison of the weighted mean squared errors, the asymptotic t-statistics for the parameters, and the plots of studentized residuals against the predicted height show that many concave and sigmoidal functions can be used to describe the height-diameter relationships. The sigmoidal functions such as the Weibull-type function, the modified logistic function, the Chapman-Richards function, and the Schnute function generally gave the most satisfactory results.},

The targeted potential natural vegetation type is usually defined by experts in vegetation sciences. Because meanwhile individual-tree growth simulators are a well acknowledged tool for predicting future forest stand development, in this study we investigate if PrognAus can also be used to predict the redevelopment of managed forest ecosystems into natural forest ecosystems regarding species composition. The development of 23 stands in Litschau has been simulated over 1,000 years under the "no-management" option. Generally, the simulated species distribution agrees quite well with the expectations of the potential natural vegetation type. However, the predicted amounts of silver fir and maple species are lower than expected, which probably is due to browsing and management effects represented in the parameterization data for PrognAus.},

  abstract = {Dendrochronology climate reconstruction studies often sample dominant, open-grown trees to reduce competition effects and isolate annual climate influences on radial increment growth. However, there has been no examination of how species respond as stand densities increase or which species in mixed-conifer forests provide a better record of past climate. We sampled 579 trees representing five upper montane mixed-conifer species at the Teakettle Experimental Forest in California's southern Sierra Nevada to determine species-specific responses to annual climatic fluctuations. Using the Kalman filter, we examined the affect of local stand density on growth response and whether the growth-climate relationship improved with a time lag. The Kalman filter iteratively calculates error for predicted versus actual radial growth and accounts for this variation in the corrector equation. Under current high-density conditions, shade-tolerant white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.) provided the best model for climate reconstruction. Shade-intolerant Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) had a lagged response to annual climatic fluctuations, possibly because its roots may tap water reserves in granitic bedrock fissures. Open-grown trees provided more accurate records of climate. Changes in forest density in this forest may have resulted in changes in species-specific response to annual climatic fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Games between trees are studied to explain the height and the crown shape in a community. It is assumed that each tree maximizes the net productivity under the light environment, which is determined by surrounding trees. In both models, the asymmetry of competition is important, because higher leaves shade lower leaves but the lower don't shade the higher. In the tree-height game, each tree is assumed to choose a height given its crown shape. The height at a monomorphic equilibrium, in which all the trees of a community have the same height, increases with the tree density and the amount of leaves per tree, but decreases with the cost coefficient and the crown thickness. When the crown is thin enough, a polymorphic equilibrium appears, in which a community includes trees of different heights but with the same fitness. In the crown-shape game, each tree is assumed to choose the distribution of foliage along the height axis. A lone tree should have a hemispherical crown as the optimum. The monomorphic equilibrium in which all the trees in a community have the same crown shape is calculated. As the tree density increases, the average height of a crown of each tree increases and the height on the tree with the maximum foliage increases, but each tree should have some foliage all the way down to the ground. Several reasons for foliage cutoff at the lowest layer are discussed.},

DMDs are based upon several ecological concepts, and thus demonstrate links between quantitative silviculture and ecology. We group the important ecological concepts incorporated into DMDs into three broad categories: (1) the generality of allometric relationships; (2) the nature of size-density relationships; and (3) the ability of relative density indices to characterize stand development. We review the evidence for each of these categories as they are applied in DMDs. There is strong evidence for the application of allometric relationships to predict stand yield and for the ability of relative density indices to characterize elements of stand development. Some ambiguity exists concerning the application of size-density relationships. Specifically, there is some evidence indicating that maximum size-density relationships may vary with genetics, management practices, and environmental conditions. In general, we conclude that DMDs rest on a strong conceptual foundation.},

  abstract = {The economic impacts of various harvesting strategies in uneven-aged beech management in Denmark are analysed, using a matrix growth model and taking into account that sales prices fluctuate over time. A vector autoregressive (VAR(1)) model is estimated on the basis of price data 1957-1998 for various assortments and used for simulating price development and consequently the economic return. It is found that harvesting strategies containing a high proportion of large trees have higher mean sales revenue, but with bigger variance, than strategies with a more even diameter distribution. If single-tree management is applied, harvesting strategies with a high proportion of large trees are relatively insensitive to harvest intensity's influence on revenue and diameter distribution. It is also found that even drastic changes of harvesting strategy do not necessarily cause large fluctuations in future revenue, indicating flexibility with respect to harvest. The simulation model results in a large standing volume compared to cyclic management, especially for large dimensions. This gives an option value with respect to adaptation to changing prices, but it also implies high storage costs and thereby a smaller land expectation value (LEV). If harvest is adapted to price fluctuations, there is a potential gain of 11% in uneven-aged management from letting the harvest cycle vary between 5 and 15 years. This is similar to the gain known from even-aged management. Therefore, a possible higher gain from adaptation in uneven-aged management must be caused by the forest structure being less sensitive to changes in ecological conditions, not by the changed assortment portfolio.

  abstract = {In this study, we analyse the economic and managerial aspects of option values related to having a mixed-species stand. As an example, we look at a mixed Norway spruce and Sitka spruce stand in Denmark when timing and intensity of future climate, and its effect on tree growth, are uncertain. Assuming that tree growth follows a discrete non-stationary stochastic process, we use dynamic programming to optimise the harvest distribution between the two species. The results show that facing growth uncertainty caused by potential climate change implies an option value. Such uncertainty can be a potential advantage as long as we are able to maintain flexibility, keep decisions open, and there is a chance that climatic change will benefit some species. We analyse the model under different uncertainty assumptions and show that the larger changes we expect, the higher is the option value at any time during the stand's life and, hence, we keep, on average, both tree species in the stand for a longer period of time. Moreover, we find that the adjustments may take place rather late in the rotation, a result brought about by the significance of the option value, which makes it optimal to maintain a reasonable stocking of both species.

Research on extreme events (?event-focused? in contrast to ?trend-focused?) has increased in recent years and, in 2004, accounted for one-fifth of the experimental climate-change studies published. Numerous examples, ranging from microbiology and soil science to biogeography, demonstrate how extreme weather events can accelerate shifts in species composition and distribution, thereby facilitating changes in ecosystem functioning. However, assessing the importance of extreme events for ecological processes poses a major challenge because of the very nature of such events: their effects are out of proportion to their short duration. We propose that extreme events can be characterized by statistical extremity, timing, and abruptness relative to the life cycles of the organisms affected. To test system response to changing magnitude and frequency of weather events, controlled experiments are useful tools. These experiments provide essential insights for science and for societies that must develop coping strategies for such events. Here, we discuss future research needs for climate-change experiments in ecology. For illustration, we describe an experimental plan showing how to meet the challenge posed by changes in the frequency or magnitude of extreme events.},

Since any given moment generating function generates an exponential dispersion model, there exists a multitude of exponential dispersion models, and some new examples are introduced. General results on convolution and asymptotic normality of exponential dispersion models are presented. Asymptotic theory is discussed, including a new small-dispersion asymptotic framework, which extends the domain of application of large-sample theory. Procedures for constructing new exponential dispersion models for correlated data are introduced, including models for longitudinal data and variance components. The results of the paper unify and generalize standard results for distributions such as the Poisson, the binomial, the negative binomial, the normal, the gamma, and the inverse Gaussian distributions.},

  abstract = {The relationship between plant diversity and productivity has largely been attributed to niche complementarity, assuming that plant species are complementary in their resource use. In this context, we conducted an N-15 field study in three. different grasslands, testing complementarity nitrogen (N) uptake patterns in terms of space, time, and chemical form as well as N strategies such as soil N use, symbiotic N fixation, or internal N recycling for different plant species. The relative contribution of different spatial, temporal, and chemical soil N pools to total soil N uptake of plants varied significantly among the investigated plant species, within and across functional groups. This suggests that plants occupy distinct niches with respect to their relative N uptake. However, when the absolute N uptake from the different soil N pools was analyzed, no spatial, temporal, or chemical variability was detected, but plants, and in particular functional groups, differed significantly with respect to their total soil N uptake irrespective of treatment. Consequently, our data suggest that absolute N exploitation on the ecosystem level is determined by species or functional group identity and thus by community composition rather than by complementary biodiversity effects. Across functional groups, total N uptake from the soil was negatively correlated with leaf N concentrations, suggesting that these functional groups follow different N use strategies to meet their N demands. While our findings give no evidence for a biodiversity effect on the quantitative exploitation of different soil N pools, there is evidence for different and complementary N strategies and thus a potentially beneficial effect of functional group diversity on ecosystem functioning.},

A total of 29 mixed stands were assessed with the registered proportion of Douglas fir at the age of 85-136 years. Comparing the 10 largest Douglas firs with the 10 largest spruces or larches, and as a rule markedly higher, the production potential of introduced Douglas fir was found in all assessed stands. There were also groups of trees where the volume of Douglas fir was twice to 3 times higher than the volume of spruce or larch. For example, in stand 177B11, the mean volume of 9.12 m 3 was recorded in the 10 largest Douglas fir trees but the volume of spruce reached only 3.17 m 3 and the volume of larch was 3.70 m 3. Differences in mensurational parameters of Douglas fir, found on the one hand, and of Norway spruce ( Picea abies) or European larch ( Larix decidua), on the other hand, compared by ANOVA tests were statistically highly significant. Annual ring analyses have shown that at present the volume increment of particular Douglas fir trees ranges from 0.12 to 0.16 m 3 year -1 in mature stands (i.e. ~1.5 m 3 every 10 years).},

  abstract = {Plant traits - the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs - determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation - but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to assess the range of genotypic variation in the vulnerability of the shoot and root xylem of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) seedlings to water-stress-induced cavitation, and to assess the trade-off between vulnerability to cavitation and conductivity per unit of stem cross-sectional area (k(s)), both within a species and within an individual tree. Douglas-fir occupies a broad range of environments and exhibits considerable genetic variation for growth, morphology, and drought hardiness. We chose two populations from each of two varieties (the coastal var, menziesii and the interior var. glauca) to represent environmental extremes of the species. Vulnerability curves were constructed for shoots and roots by plotting the percentage loss in conductivity versus water potential. Vulnerability in shoot and root xylem varied genetically with source climate. Stem xylem differed in vulnerability to cavitation between populations; the most mesic population, coastal wet (CW), was the most susceptible of the four populations. In the roots, the most vulnerable population was again CW; the interior wet (TW) population was moderately susceptible compared with the two dry populations, coastal dry (CD) and interior dry (ID). Root xylem was more susceptible to cavitation than stein xylem and had significantly greater k(s). The trade-off between vulnerability to cavitation and k(s), however, was not evident across populations. The most vulnerable population (CW) had a shoot k(s) of 0.534 +/- 0.067 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) MPa-1, compared with 0.734 +/- 0.067 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) MPa-1 for the less vulnerable CD stems. In the roots, TW was more vulnerable than ID, but had the same k(s).},

  pages =    {67-81},
  abstract = {Carbon (C) sinks created by forests depend on the balance between C uptake through photosynthesis and loss through respiration. This balance varies depending on the relative effect of environmental drivers on these processes. Components and dynamics of the C cycle were measured in a native Eucalyptus delegatensis forest at Tumbarumba in south-eastern Australia during conditions of average rainfall (1998–2001) and droughts (2002–2003 and 2006–2007). In 2002–03 there were interacting disturbance factors of dry conditions and insect damage that reduced the photosynthetically active leaf area in the canopy. Conditions during the droughts included reduced soil moisture content, higher temperatures and increased vapour pressure deficit. Similarly low soil moisture contents occurred during both drought periods, but lasted for longer in 2002–03. The combined impact of drought stress and insect damage resulted in markedly reduced growth (45–80%) and higher mortality of trees (5–60%). Impacts were variable across the 50,000 ha of forest, with mortality greatest in stands with normally highest growth rates, and in locations with greatest reductions in soil moisture. Growth rates were reduced during 2002–03, most severely in 2003–04, and recovering in 2004–05. Mortality remained high in 2004–05 indicating the prolonged effect of the stress conditions. The total C pool in the forest is 483 tC ha−1 with net C uptake of −6.7 tC ha−1 yr−1 in the growing season prior to the insect attack (2001–02). Under conditions of drought and insect disturbance in 2003 the forest released a total of 1.7 tC ha−1 over 8 months, while under conditions of drought alone carbon uptake was −6.5 tC ha−1 yr−1 in the growing season year of 2006–07 and −5.6 tC ha−1 yr−1 in the calendar year of 2007. Interacting stress factors of drought and insect damage resulted in a large imbalance in the C budget with a 26% reduction in gross primary productivity and a 9% reduction in ecosystem respiration, whereas drought alone had a much lesser effect. Drought conditions result in (1) weather conditions that break the synchronisation of insects with parasites and predators resulting in insect outbreaks, (2) moisture stress that predisposes trees to attack by insects, and (3) moisture stress that restricts leaf regeneration after damage. Climate change and climatically induced changes in disturbance regimes may affect the processes of photosynthesis and respiration differently and hence change the balance of net ecosystem C exchange. Reduced sink strength of forests will lead to positive C cycle–climate feedbacks, which enhance the greenhouse effect and climate change.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial vegetation plays a central role in regulating the carbon and water cycles, and adjusting planetary albedo. As such, a clear understanding and accurate characterization of vegetation dynamics is critical to understanding and modeling the broader climate system. Maximum tree height is an important feature of forest vegetation because it is directly related to the overall scale of many ecological and environmental quantities and is an important indicator for understanding several properties of plant communities, including total standing biomass and resource use. We present a model that predicts local maximal tree height across the entire continental United States, in good agreement with data. The model combines scaling laws, which encode the average, base-line behavior of many tree characteristics, with energy budgets constrained by local resource limitations, such as precipitation, temperature and solar radiation. In addition to predicting maximum tree height in an environment, our framework can be extended to predict how other tree traits, such as stomatal density, depend on these resource constraints. Furthermore, it offers predictions for the relationship between height and whole canopy albedo, which is important for understanding the Earth's radiative budget, a critical component of the climate system. Because our model focuses on dominant features, which are represented by a small set of mechanisms, it can be easily integrated into more complicated ecological or climate models.},

Investigated domain envelops the period of degraded climatic sensitivity of pines' growth. Chemical data were standardized for sapwood and heartwood separately. The averaged sulphur record calculated from the three individual records unequivocally presents anomalously high S content for the tree rings dated to 1970s and 1980s. Ring-width fluctuation portrays changes of summer temperature but from 1966 to 1986 pines produced apparently larger rings than the corresponding summer temperatures can explain. This deviating interval coincides with the period of exploitation in the nearby sulphur mine. The elevated S content in tree rings refers probably to the dispersion of S-rich dust around the mine owing to the opencast type of exploitation. The divergent growth trend and degraded climatic signal likely due to the anthropogenic altered nutritional status of the site, as residues from nitrogen fertilizer, applied as a compound of explosive in the opencast sulphur exploitation, could be deposited on the surrounding forest.

Freckleton, Watkinson & Rees (2009) criticize a recent paper by ourselves in this journal (Brooker & Kikvidze 2008) as well as our earlier work on competition importance (Brooker et al. 2005). In response, here we clarify our ideas with the aim of defining more clearly the key points of scientific debate, specifically (i) the definition of the importance of competition and (ii) its measurement. 2. Freckleton, Watkinson & Rees (2009) interpret the classic paper by Welden & Slauson (1986) such that importance as a concept relates to long-term, population-level consequences of competition. However, we consider competition importance to be the proportional impact of competition relative to the overall impact of the environment, and our index C(imp) expresses changes in competition importance - as defined by ourselves - along productivity gradients. We argue that our definition more accurately reflects the work of Welden & Slauson, as well as a more recent use of the concept (Grace 1991), which precedes the work of Freckleton & Watkinson (2001). 3. We highlight that C(imp) was never proposed as a general index of competition importance, but is readily applicable in certain circumstances. Notably, our index and the approaches to measuring competition importance as set out by Freckleton, Watkinson & Rees (2009) are not unrelated. 4. We also discuss some recent additional responses to both our (2008) paper and that by Freckleton, Watkinson & Rees (2009), including applications of the concept of competition importance. Although the authors of these papers may not have used our index C(imp), they follow the same definitions for the overall concept of competition importance as ourselves. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that the complex topic of biotic interactions, including the specific issue of the importance of competition, invites a range of approaches. Importantly, these approaches can be complementary and not conflicting. Here, we propose what we see as a sensible resolution to the current debate concerning the definition of competition importance, a resolution which is backed by the original source article, literature precedent and current usage.},

In this paper, a method that requires two variables that are linearly correlated was applied to determine the sample size for fitting taper equations. Two cases of sample size estimation were tested, based on the method mentioned above. In the first case, the sample size required is referred to the total number of diameters estimated in the sampled trees. In the second case, the sample size required is referred to the number of sampled trees. The analysis showed that both methods are efficient from a validity standpoint but the first method has the advantage of decreased cost, since it costs much more to incrementally sample another tree than it does to make another diameter measurement on an already sampled tree.},

They all belong to the subgenus Lepidobalanus. The most important section is robur with 21 species. The European species belong to both deciduous (15 species) and evergreen (9 species) oaks. Some difficulties in clear morphological and physiological definition of the species involved is caused by hybridization. Most studies into intraspecific variation exist for the species Quercus robur L and Quercus petraea (Matt) Liebl. Some information is available for Quercus cerris L, Quercus virginiana Ten (= Q dalechampii Wenz), Quercus ilex L and Quercus suber L, based on comparative plantations. In addition, a considerable number of morphological, physiological and biochemical studies based on natural populations exist which are not completely covered in this review paper. For most characters observed, oaks exhibit a wide variation. This is not only the case for morphological traits of pollen, seed, wood and plants but also for physiological traits and phenology which have great adaptive importance. Provenance experiments and progeny tests started as early as 1877. Most of these were only of local importance. This is partly due to the fact that acorns can only be stored for a limited period and flowering is irregular. However, the results available show that the choice of provenance can be important for the successful economic management of plantations. Variability of leaves, phenology, form, growth, wood and bark, roots, seed and flowering has been discussed separately. Improvement via selection and testing seems to be promising due to the considerable between-population and within-provenance variation. Vegetative propagation has been developed for some species by grafting, cutting propagation and in vitro propagation. Tree breeding approaches have also been discussed.},

  abstract = {This article is a synthesis of the salient topics discussed in the Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Workshop, held at the University of British Columbia, February 14-16, 2011, and lays out a research agenda based on the recommendations for future research that emerged in the workshop. The proposed research agenda is framed using the theory of reflexive modernization to enable the forest research community to consider how different modes of knowledge production can support adaptation within SFM. The workshop discussions highlighted the importance of considering extreme events and high uncertainty in planning for adaptation within SFM. Participants discussed the utility of climate change modeling and risk assessment for local decision-making. In addition, there was general agreement that adaptive collaborative management could facilitate adaptation within SFM, despite difficulties in implementation. The recommendations for future research that emerged from the workshop focused on climate change-related assessments, modeling techniques, and governance and institutional enablers/barriers to adaptation. This broad research agenda, however, can be approached using different modes of knowledge production, illustrating different orders of reflexivity. Apart from a call for more traditional academic research to improve SFM under climate change, workshop participants referred to the need for participatory research, in which researchers would be embedded in communities and other contexts of application, engaging in a "client-focused" partnership model to produce knowledge that is robust, compelling, legitimate and, above all, locally relevant. It is hoped that this alternative mode of knowledge production would result in a social license and greater political will to accelerate adaptation within SFM.},

Nees, and Acer rubrum L. from adjacent open and understory sites in the central Pennsylvania barrens, United States. Saplings of all species exhibited significant physiological and morphological plasticity, which included greater area-based photosynthesis, leaf conductance, water-use efficiency, stomatal density, specific leaf mass, and leaf thickness on the open site. However, only Q. velutina had greater net photosynthesis in the open versus understory when photosynthesis was expressed on a mass basis. The earlier successional Quercus spp. and S. albidum exhibited higher diurnal and seasonal gas exchange in the open than the later successional A. rubrum, although all species exhibited significant diurnal declines in photosynthesis. Quercus spp. exhibited a 56-62% greater decrease in diurnal water potential compared with S. albidum and A. rubrum in both the open and understory. Sassafras maintained high gas-exchange rates in the open without experiencing large diurnal tissue water deficits. Seasonal variations in net photosynthesis and leaf conductance were significantly correlated with each other and with specific leaf mass. Light-response curves predicted greater saturating light levels and greater rates of maximum photosynthesis in the early successional species versus A. rubrum, but similar light compensation values in all species. The results of this study suggest that each species displayed many similar and unique adaptations and responses to varying light and water availability in the barrens environment.},

  abstract = {The distribution of hollow-using fauna is frequently related to forest type. If hollow occurrence varies with forest type, the use of generic prescriptions for managing the hollow resource may be inappropriate. This study examined the relationship between the occurrence and abundance of tree hollows and site and tree attributes in wet and dry Eucalyptus obliqua forest in Tasmania, Australia. A total of 388 trees at 39 sites were examined before and after being felled. Evidence of invertebrate damage contributing to hollow formation was more common in wet forest than either dry or damp forest. Evidence of hollow formation by fire and fungi was more prevalent in drier than wetter forest. There was no difference among forest types in the proportion of hollows showing evidence of limb breakage. Examination of the site and tree factors related to hollow presence and abundance was done using Classification Trees, Random Forests and generalised linear models. The variables found to be most practical for predicting hollow occurrence were the number of hollows observed before the tree was felled, tree diameter and the amount of dead wood in the canopy. Tree age, an important variable to consider when planning harvest rotations, was strongly associated with hollow presence but had less bearing on hollow abundance. The size of hollows that were found in a tree was related to greater senescence. Although significantly more hollows of all sizes were found in wet forest than either dry or damp forest, the age at which trees began to produce hollows was similar among the different forest types. The models predicted that trees needed to be at least 100 years old before they are likely to contain a hollow and that medium-sized hollows rarely occur in trees younger than 140 years old. Trees grow slightly more slowly in dry forest than wet which means that smaller diameter trees were found to contain hollows in dry forest than wet and that even the largest trees may not contain large hollows in wet forest. Despite this, no differentiation between the forest types was found in the predictive models. It is recommended that trees retained for faunal habitat be at least 100 cm in diameter. © 2008.},

  abstract = {To investigate whether drought tolerance of individual trees can be increased through the provision of more growing space, trees from a thinning experiment were analysed for reductions in radial growth during drought years and their subsequent recovery. Tree-ring widths were quantified on increment cores as well as stem discs of 32 trees from stands of a thinning trial established in 1974 in 27-year-old spruce stands in the Alpine Foreland of Southwest Germany. Three different thinning regimes of the trial were selected for this study: unthinned control (8 trees), moderate (13 trees) and heavy thinning (11 trees) intensities. All trees sampled were of a co-dominant to dominant canopy status. The standardisation of growth data was carried out using the software program ARSTAN (University of Arizona). For the year 1976-a widespread and severe drought year in Germany-we found year ring widths were not reduced compared to those of the pre-drought years for all treatments. However, we observed the formation of false year rings and resin ducts for this year in all trees investigated. The drought events in 1992 and 2003 led to severe growth depressions in the year of the drought event in all trees, regardless of previous thinning regimes. However, the resilience-the recovery of basal area growth in subsequent years-was significantly more rapid in trees from heavily thinned stands, even if the drought event occurred more than 10 years after the last thinning intervention. This indicates a shorter stress period for trees with more growing space, which may reduce the susceptibility to secondary pathogens or pest species such as bark beetles.},

  abstract = {Cet article est une synthèse des travaux réalisés sur l’analyse de la diversité génétique des Chênes sessile et pédonculé à l’échelle de l’aire de distribution des espèces prenant en compte la diversité moléculaire et phénotypique. La confrontation de données génétiques et historiques (pollens fossiles) a permis de reconstituer les principaux mécanismes qui ont façonné cette diversité et notamment ceux qui ont accompagné la colonisation post-glaciaire. Confinés dans trois zones refuges au cours du dernier âge glaciaire, les Chênes ont très rapidement, en moins de 8 000 ans, colonisé l’Europe grâce notamment à des dispersions rares mais à longue distance. La distribution géographique du polymorphisme de l’ADN chloroplastique témoigne encore de cette migration. Après la recolonisation, les flux de pollen ont homogénéisé au plan génétique les massifs forestiers et la sélection naturelle a, depuis, généré des différences pour les caractères adaptatifs. L’hybridation a joué un rôle très important au cours de cette histoire, en permettant notamment au Chêne sessile de migrer et de coloniser des espaces nouveaux par introgression dans les peuplements de Chêne pédonculé déjà établis.

The manuscript is a synthesis of ten years of research on the distribution of genetic diversity of European oaks (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur) including molecular and phenotypic diversity. By comparing the genetic and historical data (fossil pollen), the main mechanisms that shaped diversity and especially the dynamics of postglacial colonisation were identified. Oaks were restricted in three refuge areas during the last glacial period and recolonised in less than 8000 years the whole European continent. The rapid colonisation was mostly due to rare but long distance dispersion events as witnessed by the extant geographic distribution of chloroplast DNA polymorphism. After colonisation, pollen flow among forests contributed to erase the genetic differentiation among stands. Finally natural selection pressures induced new genetic differences among provenances. Interspecific hybridisation was also an important dispersion mechanism enabling Quercus petraea to colonise new sites by introgression into Quercus robur stands.},

The current values of final cutting yield, dependent on tree species, site index and the length of rotation period served as a basis for the assessment of expected yields. The possibilities and limitations of index applicability in long-term strategic forest management decision-making are discussed, considering the uncertainty of ecological and economic conditions during the long forest production cycle, as well as the complexity of tree species growth and production in the mixed forests, uneven aged forests and forests under climate change.},

  abstract = {P>1. Plant interactions play a central role in regulating plant communities and this role can be altered by abiotic stress. With increasing stress, ecological theory predicts that the role of competition decreases whilst that of facilitation increases. Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. 2. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17 000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plant-plant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plant-plant interactions. 3. Our analyses revealed that competition - measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth - varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. 4.Synthesis. Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plant-plant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plant-plant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plant-plant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {1. A trade-off between growth in high-light and survival in low-light of species is often proposed as a key mechanism underpinning the dynamics of trees in forest communities. Yet, growth and survival are known to depend on plant size and few studies have analysed how this trade-off can vary between juvenile life stages and the potential consequences of the trade-off for the differences in regeneration rate between species in mixed forests. 2. We quantified growth and mortality for two different juvenile life stages-seedlings and saplings -of seven tree species common in temperate rain forests in New Zealand using data from field studies. We found strong evidence that the ranking of species for survival in shade and growth in full light was affected by size. There was a trade-off between seedling survival in low light and sapling height growth in high light, but no trade-offs were observed when considering other combinations of life stages (seedling growth vs. seedling survival, seedling growth vs. sapling survival, or sapling growth vs. sapling survival). 3. We ran simulations with an individual-based forest dynamics model-SORTIE/NZ-to explore how the trade-off drives the differences in tree species regeneration success in gaps vs. under closed forest conditions. These simulations indicate that because species' ranks in shade tolerance varied with life stage, regeneration success was not predicted from knowledge of tree performance at a single life stage. For instance, high-light sapling growth was a strong determinant of regeneration success in forest gaps, but seedling growth was also influential. Under closed forest, regeneration success was primarily limited by low-light mortality at the seedling stage, but seedling growth and sapling survival were also influential. 4. Synthesis. Growth-survival trade-offs can be strongly affected by the size of the individual analysed, resulting in completely different rankings of the shade tolerance of species across different juvenile life stages. Performance of both seedlings and saplings influenced regeneration success, highlighting the need to consider growth-survival trade-offs and the shade-tolerance strategies of tree species over a large range of juvenile sizes.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process-based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; PG) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (φp.a.u.), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy (φp.a.) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. PG is obtained from φp.a.u. and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (PN) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate PN—the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios—widely available for many species and situations—to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the −32 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stem diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach, based on a mixed model procedure, to quantify the tree-ring-based growth-climate relationship of trembling aspen along a latitudinal gradient from 46 to 54 degrees N in eastern Canada. This approach allows breaking down the growth response into general intersite and local climatic responses, and analyzing variations of absolute ring width as well as interannual variations in tree growth. The final model also integrates nonclimatic variables such as soil characteristics and the occurrence of insect outbreaks into the growth predictions. Tree level random effects on growth were important as intercepts but were nonsignificant for the climatic variables, indicating that a single climate-growth relationship was justified in our case. The response of tree growth to climate showed, however, a strong dependence on the spatial scale at which the analysis was performed. Intersite variations in tree growth were mostly dependent on variations in the thermal heat sum, a variable that showed low interannual and high intersite variation. When variation for a single site was analyzed, other variables showed up to be important while the heat sum was unimportant. Finally, future growth under six different climate change scenarios was simulated in order to study the potential impact of climate change. Results suggest only moderate growth increases in the northern portion of the gradient and a growth decrease in the southern portion under future climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {As global climate changes over the next century, forest productivity is expected to change as well. Using PRISM climate and productivity data measured on a grid of 3356 plots, we developed a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model to estimate the impacts of climate change on potential productivity of Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests of the United States. Productivity, measured by projected potential mean annual increment (PMAI) at culmination, is explained by the interaction of annual temperature, precipitation, and precipitation in excess of evapotranspiration through the growing season. By utilizing information regarding spatial error in the SAR model, the resulting spatial bias is reduced thereby improving the accuracy of the resulting maps. The model, coupled with climate change output from four generalized circulation models, was used to predict the productivity impacts of four different scenarios derived from the fourth IPCC special report on emissions, representing different future economic and environmental states of the world, viz., scenario A1B, A2, B1 (low growth, high economic development and low energy usage), and COMMIT. In these scenarios, regional average temperature is expected to increase from 0.5 to 4.5 degrees C, while precipitation shows no clear trend over time. For the west and east side of the Cascade Mountains, respectively, PMAI increases: 7% and 20% under A1B scenario: 8% and 23% under scenario A2; 5% and 15% under scenario B1, and 2% and 5% under the COMMIT scenario. These projections should be viewed as potential changes in productivity, since they do not reflect the mitigating effects of any shifts in management or public policy. For managers and policy makers, the results suggest the relative magnitude of effects and the potential variability of impacts across a range of climate scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In the climate change discussion, the possibility of carbon sequestration of forests plays an important role. Therefore, research on the effects of environmental changes on net primary productivity is interesting. In this study we investigated the influence of changing temperature, precipitation and deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds on forest growth. The database consisted of 654 plots of the European intensive monitoring program (Level 11 plots) with 5-year growth data for the period 1994-1999. Among these 654 plots only 382 plots in 18 European countries met the requirements necessary to be used in our analysis. Our analysis was done for common beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus petraea and Q. robur), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). We developed an individual tree growth model with measured basal area increment of each individual tree as responding growth factor and tree size (diameter at breast height), tree competition (basal area of larger trees and stand density index), site factors (soil C/N ratio, temperature), and environmental factors (temperature change compared to long-term average, nitrogen and sulphur deposition) as influencing parameters. Using a mixed model approach, all models for the tree species show a high goodness of fit with Pseudo-R(2) between 0.33 and 0.44. Diameter at breast height and basal area of larger trees were highly influential variables in all models. Increasing temperature shows a positive effect on growth for all species except Norway spruce. Nitrogen deposition shows a positive impact on growth for all four species. This influence was significant with p < 0.05 for all species except common beech. For beech the effect was nearly significant (p = 0.077). An increase of 1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) corresponds to an increase in basal area increment between 1.20% and 1.49% depending on species. Considering an average total carbon uptake for European forests near 1730 kg per hectare and year, this implies an estimated sequestration of approximately 2126 kg carbon per kg nitrogen deposition.

  abstract = {We investigated the fire resistance conferred by bark of seven common tree species in north Australian tropical savannas. We estimated bark thermal conductance and examined the relative importance of bark thickness, density and moisture content for protecting the cambium from lethal fire temperatures. Eucalypt and non-eucalypt species were contrasted, including the fire-sensitive conifer Callitris intratropica. Cambial temperature responses to bark surface heating were measured using a modified wick-fire technique, which simulated a heat pulse comparable to surface fires of moderate intensity. Bark thickness was a better predictor of resistance to cambial injury from fires than either bark moisture or density, accounting for 68% of the deviance in maximum temperature of the cambium. The duration of heating required to kill the cambium of a tree (&#x3c4; c ) was directly proportional to bark thickness squared. Although species did not differ significantly in their bark thermal conductance (k), the thinner barked eucalypts nevertheless achieved similar or only slightly lower levels of fire resistance than much thicker barked non-eucalypts. Bark thickness alone cannot account for the latter and we suggest that lower bark moisture content among the eucalypts also contributes to their apparent fire resistance. Unique eucalypt meristem anatomy and epicormic structures, combined with their bark traits, probably facilitate resprouting after fire and ensure the dominance of eucalypts in fire-prone savannas. This study emphasises the need to take into account both the thermal properties of bark and the mechanism of bud protection in characterising the resprouting ability of savanna trees.},

  abstract = {Two statistical modelling techniques, generalized additive models (GAM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used to analyse relationships between the distributions of 15 freshwater fish species and their environment. GAM and MARS models were fitted individually for each species, and a MARS multiresponse model was fitted in which the distributions of all species were analysed simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using changes in deviance in the fitted models and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calculated using a bootstrap assessment procedure that simulates predictive performance for independent data. Results indicate little difference between the performance of GAM and MARS models, even when MARS models included interaction terms between predictor variables. Results from MARS models are much more easily incorporated into other analyses than those from GAM models. The strong performance of a MARS multiresponse model, particularly for species of low prevalence, suggests that it may have distinct advantages for the analysis of large datasets. Its identification of a parsimonious set of environmental correlates of community composition, coupled with its ability to robustly model species distributions in relation to those variables, can be seen as converging strongly with the purposes of traditional ordination techniques.

The relationships between climate and ring widths were analyzed using extreme growth years, simple correlations and response functions analysis (bootstrapped coefficients). Monthly climatic regressors were derived by a physiological water balance model that used daily climatic data and stand parameters to estimate soil water deficits. Pointer years underline the high sensitivity to winter frosts (1956, 1986) and exceptional annual droughts (1962, 1976, 1991) for both species. For those years, growth variations were higher for Abies alba than for Picea abies. For each species, the climate information of tree ring series is not modified by local site characteristics (altitude, slope, aspect, soil water reserve). Moreover, strong specific differences appear among species. Earlywood and latewood spruce growth mainly depends on current summer soil water deficit conditions. For silver fir, winter and early summer temperatures, as well as the water supply of the previous year (August to October) play a major role for the production of earlywood, after which the current early summer water supply influences mainly latewood width.},

  abstract = {The influence of climate on the radial growth of Fagus sylvatica was investigated using 15 chronologies developed from mature stands of the French Permanent Plot Network (RENECOFOR) growing under different climatic and soil conditions. The relationships between climate and ring widths were analyzed using extreme growth years, simple correlations and response functions analysis. Monthly climatic regressors were derived by a physiological water balance model that used daily climatic data and stand parameters to estimate soil water deficits. The three most frequent negative pointer years (1959, 1989, 1976) result from a particularly intense and durable drought, whereas positive years (1977, 1958) coincide with wet conditions. The total ring chronology variance attributable to climate averages 34.1% (15.8%-57%). Current early-summer soil water deficit enters in 10 models and the deficit in June explains alone a large part of the radial growth variability (mean value: 26.6%). Temperature or soil water deficit for the other months and weather conditions during the previous season were of little consistency across stands. The response pattern of earlywood is very similar and the percentage of variance explained is higher (16.2%-57.8%). Latewood widths present a different response pattern. High minimum temperature in August and/or September often favour wide latewood widths and monthly water deficits play a secondary role. The percentage of variance explained ranges from 8.8% to 67.4%. Soil water capacity strongly modulates ring characteristics and climate-growth relationships. Mean sensitivity, expressed population signal, signal-to-noise ratio and the strength of growth-climate correlations increase with decreasing soil water capacity.},

According to the number of healthy trees alive (>400), the stand age (>300 years), and the dimensions of the trees (dia: 92 cm; height: 45.2 m), this plot constitutes one of the most remarkable oak grove in France. High competition pressure between trees appeared to be the most important factor to explain the high-quality timber (high straight stems without wood defaults, narrow regular rings). After an initial 90-year period of decrease, this stand shows a 1 mm.year(-1) growth increment from the 1810s to the present. The growth increase of 40-50% occurring for over than 20 years can be interpreted as a response to the increase of harvesting intensity. The influence of climate was evaluated by comparing earlywood, latewood and total ring indices with monthly climatic data collected at Le Mans over the period 1921-2001. Extreme growth years coincided with wet or dry springs (May-June) (+/-40% of rainfall in relation to normal conditions) often associated with warm or fresh July. The climatic models accounted for between 18 and 26% of the variability of ring widths, and suggested that earlywood formation depended mainly on previous autumn hydric balance and winter temperature whereas the growth of the latewood band was maximum in early spring (positive effect of May hydric balance). The ecophysiological interpretations of the climatic correlations are discussed.},

Stand level competition was considered through three stand basal area (SBA) modalities (Low: 32 m2/ha, Medium: 41 and High: 49) while tree level competition was assessed through three social statuses (SST, Dominant, Codominant and Suppressed trees). A strong specific response to climate was pointed out with different key periods; growth of Abies being mainly driven by previous and current late summer temperatures, while that of Fagus was controlled by April and June ones. No obvious difference between facing sides was evidenced. Competition at stand level prevailed on competition at tree level. In Low and Medium SBA, trees exhibited similar responses to climate whatever their social statuses. On the opposite, sensitivity to summer drought increased with dominancy in high SBA. Inter-specific differences and consequences for forest management are discussed.},

  abstract = {Significant warming already observed in Europe and in France together with predictions made at the end of the 20th century raise questions in the forestry and forest-based community about the sustainability of species and ecosystems in this rapidly changing context. A dendroclimatological approach can be adopted to analyse the response of species to climate, in which inter-annual variations in radial increment are explained using temperature and water climatic factors. This analysis relies on a fundamental principle referred to as "the principle of uniformity" that sets out that the physical and biological processes that govern the growth of trees currently growing are the same as in the past and have the same type of effect. In other words, the response of trees to year-to-year climate variations is assumed to be stable over time. However, for some years now, this principle of uniformity has been challenged by environmental changes that reflect instability of tree response to climate over time. This instability is referred to as "the divergence problem". This article summarises current knowledge about the sensitivity to climate of forest species and divergence problems encountered in the various northern hemisphere forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The relationship between cyclones and extreme wind events over Europe under climate change conditions is analysed using global as well as regional climate model simulations. In this study, climate change simulations based on the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 are used. Cyclone systems over the Northeast Atlantic and Europe are identified for the Hadley Centre global general circulation model HadCM3 using an objective algorithm based on the search of the maxima of the Laplacian of the mean sea-level pressure (MSLP). Cyclone tracks are recognized in a second step of the procedure. Extreme cyclone systems are defined via the exceedance of the 95th percentile of the Laplacian of MSLP for each system. Extreme wind events are defined similar by values above the 95th percentile of the daily maximum wind speed at the lowest model level and related to the core pressure of the nearest cyclone system. Although the overall number of modelled tracks is underestimated in the control period of the global model's simulation with present-day greenhouse gas forcing, compared to reanalysis data, realistic patterns of the track density over the investigation area are simulated. Changes occur in particular with respect to the A2 scenario for extreme cyclone systems, while for B2 the changes are less pronounced. Especially over western parts of Central Europe, the track density of extreme cyclones increases for A2, accompanied by a tendency towards more intense systems. With respect to the A2 scenario, a tendency towards more extreme wind events caused by deepening cyclones is identified for several regions of Western Europe such as Spain, France, United Kingdom or Germany. Additionally, the climate change signal in the regional climate model (RCM) HadRM3H is analysed. In accordance with the signal of the wind speed changes in the GCM simulation, the RCM reveals an increase of the 95th percentile of the daily maximum wind speed over extended parts of Western Europe related to the areas of increased track density of extreme cyclones under the A2 scenario. Changes with respect to the SRES B2 scenario are similar in their structure, but less pronounced in their amplitude.},

  abstract = {We studied tree interactions by estimating competition under different modeling frameworks and relating it to observed stem volume growth. Three types of models were tested: type 1, spatially explicit simulation based on the measured tree coordinates; type 2, distance-independent perfect plasticity approximations, relating volume growth to tree height; and type 3, purely empirical size-driven models, regressing growth on size. We used three stem-mapped mixed-wood plots from central British Columbia, Canada, approximately 37 years old. The stand was planted with spruce seedlings and subsequently received hardwood natural regeneration, mostly birch, alder, aspen, and willows. The plots represented an untreated control and two different brushing treatments. Models of type 1 showed less prediction ability than the simpler type 2 models, suggesting that plasticity is important and diminishes the effects of spatial structure. Type 3 models, using current volume as a predictor of volume increment, resulted in much higher <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> values. Tree size reflects accumulated past growth, so that these models are largely simple empirical extrapolations. Size-driven models can be highly effective for yield forecasting in relatively undisturbed stands but may not be reliable after natural disturbances, management interventions, or environmental changes.},

  abstract = {The authors link time-to-event models with longitudinal models through shared latent variables when the time of the event of interest is known only to lie within an interval. The context of tree growth and mortality studies presents a natural application of shared parameter joint modelling where a latent feature of each tree impacts both mortality and growth. The authors' developments are motivated by such an application, with the additional caveat that event-times are not known exactly, since the trees are subject to intermittent observation, with the time between measurements extending into decades or longer. Such interval censoring is a common occurrence in similar long-term experiments in resource management, ecology and health research. The additional numerical complexity resulting from interval censored time-to-event data often makes inference for joint models prohibitive. The authors examine properties of three event-time imputation methods that enable application of now standard joint modelling techniques to interval censored time-to-event data. The imputation techniques include the midpoint method, a kernel smoothing method, and a backsolve method which incorporates information from the longitudinal trajectory. Joint analysis of a designed, long-term, forestry experiment is presented, accompanied by a simulation study investigating the properties of the three event-time imputation techniques.

Les changements climatiques vont affecter la composition des peuplements, non seulement par la modification du climat moyen, mais aussi par la modification du régime des perturbations, ou encore indirectement par les effets induits sur la filière forêt-bois et les stratégies des sylviculteurs. Ces effets, complexes, pourraient notamment s’opérer au bénéfice des pionnières et des espèces déplacées par l’homme, et aboutir à des dynamiques inédites. Mais le mélange des espèces peut également être mis à profit par le gestionnaire pour atténuer les impacts du changement climatique, et adapter progressivement et souplement la composition des peuplements. Les situations de mélange méritent d’ailleurs d’être mieux analysées, pour alimenter cette réflexion technique, mais également pour mieux comprendre les effets de changement en cours en jouant sur la différenciation des réponses des composants du mélange.

This article attempts to provide an overview of the interaction between climate change and species mixture in forest stands. Climate change affects stand composition not only because average climate is changed but also due to the change in the disturbance regime, as well as indirectly through the induced effects on the forestry and forest-based industries and forest management strategies. These complex effects could be favourable to pioneer species and ones that have been displaced by man, possibly leading to unprecedented dynamics. However, forest managers too may use species mixtures to reduce the impact of climate change by gradually and flexibly adapting stand composition. Mixed species sites in fact deserve more extensive research so as to inform these technical decisions, but also to gain a better understanding of the effects of ongoing changes through the differentiated response of the species entering into the composition.},

The objective of this study was to extend these relations to younger development stages and test if specific relations are needed to be established for a set of species of different shade tolerance, including beech, ash, sycamore maple, and oak. We relied on stands growing at maximum density and used selected data coming from the inventories of permanent control plots and specifically established temporary plots. A multiple comparison procedure was used to differentiate between the parameters of the relations. Two size-density relations were retained with a common slope and different intercepts for ash and beech on one hand, and for oak and sycamore maple on the other hand. Stands of shade-intolerant species like oak appeared able to hold less trees of a given mean size, but shade tolerance did not seem to influence the mortality rate which appeared to be the same.},

Species that have ample intraspecific genetic differentiation, such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), are expected to. display population-specific growth responses to climate change. Using a mixed-effects modeling approach, we describe three-year height. (HT) growth response to changes in climate of interior Douglas-fir populations. We incorporate climate information at the population level, yielding a model that is specific to both species and population. We use data from provenance tests from previous studies that comprised 236 populations from Idaho, Montana, and eastern Washington, USA. The most sensitive indicator of climate was the mean temperature of the coldest month. Population maximum HT and HT growth response to changes in climate were dependent on seed source climate. All populations had optimum HT growth when transferred to climates with warmer winters; those originating in sites with the. warmest winters were taller across sites and had highest HT growth at transfer distances closest to zero; those from colder climates were shortest and had optimum HT growth when transferred the farthest. Although this differential response damped the height growth differences among populations, cold-climate populations still achieved their maximum growth at lower temperatures than warm-climate populations. The results highlight the relevance of understanding climate change impacts at the population level, particularly in a species with ample genetic variation, among populations.},

  abstract = {Relationships between stand growth and structural diversity were examined in spruce-dominated forests in New Brunswick, Canada. Net growth, survivor growth, mortality, and recruitment represented stand growth, and tree species, size, and height diversity indices were used to describe structural diversity. Mixed-effects second-order polynomial regressions were employed for statistical analysis. Results showed stand structural diversity had a significant positive effect on net growth and survivor growth by volume but not on mortality and recruitment. Among the tested diversity indices, the integrated diversity of tree species and height contributed most to stand net growth and survivor growth. Structural diversity showed increasing trends throughout the developmental stages from young, immature, mature, and overmature forest stands. This relationship between stand growth and structural diversity may be due to stands featuring high structural diversity that enhances niche complementarities of resource use because trees exist within different horizontal and vertical layers, and strong competition resulted from size differences among trees. It is recommended to include effects of species and structural diversity in forest growth modeling initiatives. Moreover, uneven-aged stand management in conjunction with selective or partial cutting to maintain high structural diversity is also recommended to maintain biodiversity and rapid growth in spruce-dominated forests.},

  abstract = {Forest modellers have long faced the problem of selecting an appropriate mathematical model to describe tree ontogenetic or size-shape empirical relationships for tree species. A common practice is to develop many models (or a model pool) that include different functional forms, and then to select the most appropriate one for a given data set. However, this process may impose subjective restrictions on the functional form. In this process, little attention is paid to the features (e.g. asymptote and inflection point rather than asymptote and nonasymptote) of different functional forms, and to the intrinsic curve of a given data set. In order to find a better way of comparing and selecting the growth models, this paper describes and analyses the characteristics of the Schnute model. This model has both flexibility and versatility that have not been used in forestry. In this study, the Schnute model was applied to different data sets of selected forest species to determine their functional forms. The results indicate that the model shows some desirable properties for the examined data sets, and allows for discerning the different intrinsic curve shapes such as sigmoid, concave and other curve shapes. Since no suitable functional form for a given data set is usually known prior to the comparison of candidate models, it is recommended that the Schnute model be used as the first step to determine an appropriate functional form of the data set under investigation in order to avoid using a functional form a priori.},

The data have a seven-levels hierarchical organization. The variability at each level is modeled with a variance matrix. Unfortunately, a model with all variances has too many parameters to be usable, so preferably only one variance other than the residual is kept. A graphical procedure based on the comparison of residual variance in the different candidate models is used to detect this main level. Result shows that the main level of variability is the "tree" level or the "height within tree" level for five properties. We cannot conclude for the last property. For other properties, the residual variance in the model with a "tree effect" is reduced to 40% of the residual variance of the model without structuring of variability. If the applications of models deal with the variability of properties, this "tree level" cannot be neglected.},

  abstract = {Growth-climate relationships were analyzed for 15 stands of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) along a productivity gradient in northeastern British Columbia. Productivity was evaluated with a site index model whose values varied between 6.65aand 26.93am height at age 50 years. To assess the role of climate on radial growth, we built a tree-ring chronology for each site and then performed a dendroclimatic analysis by means of bootstrapped correlation functions using monthly and annual climatic variables. We found that trembling aspen sensitivity to climate varied across stands with different productivities in the study area. At the more productive sites, trees were more sensitive to climate, and ring widths were positively correlated, particularly with summer month precipitation prior to the year of growth. The different responses to climate along the productivity gradient are likely related to the differences in substrate properties; substrates at the more productive sites are richer in nutrients and have a better water holding capacity than those of the less productive sites. Our study suggests that the effects of future climate change on tree growth may not only increase towards the limit of a species distribution, but also towards richer and wetter stands.},

  abstract = {Recently a divergence between tree-ring parameters from temperature-limited environments and temperature records has been observed worldwide but comprehensive explanations are still lacking. From a dendroclimatic analysis performed on a high-altitude tree-ring network of Pinus cembra (L.) in the Central Italian Alps we found that site aspect influences non-stationary growth-climate relationships over time. A general increasing divergence between ring width and the summer temperature record (J-A) has been observed especially for chronologies from SW-facing slopes, whereas chronologies from N-facing sites showed stable relationships over time. The monthly analysis revealed that the decrease in sensitivity was mostly accounted for by the changes in the relationships with June temperature (decreasing correlations especially for S- and W-facing site chronologies), whereas trees from N-facing sites showed an increasing sensitivity to July temperatures. Our data suggest that at high altitudes, low temperatures at the beginning of the growing season no longer limit growth. We also found that our temperature-sensitive trees did not linearly respond in radial growth to the extreme heat event of summer 2003, and formed an annual ring of average width, resulting in a strong divergence from the temperature record. Our findings underline the importance of site ecology for tree-ring based climate reconstructions using temperature-sensitive ring-width chronologies, and may help in solving the 'divergence problem'.},

  abstract = {In 2003, Central Europe experienced the warmest summer on record combined with unusually low precipitation. We studied plant water relations and phenology in a 100-year-old mixed deciduous forest on a slope (no ground water table) near Basel using the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC). The drought lasted from early June to mid September. We studied five deciduous tree species; half of the individuals were exposed to elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) (530 ppm) using a free-air, atmospheric CO2-enrichment system. In late July, after the first eight weeks of drought, mean predawn leaf water potential about 30 m above ground was -0.9 MPa across all trees, dropping to a mean of -1.5 MPa in mid-August when the top 1 m of the soil profile had no plant accessible moisture. Mean stomatal conductance and rates of maximum net photosynthesis decreased considerably in mid-August across all species. However, daily peak values of sap flow remained surprisingly constant over the whole period in Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., and decreased to only about half of the early summer maxima in Fagus sylvatica L. and Carpinus betulus L. (stomatal down-regulation of flux). Although we detected no differences in most parameters between CO2-treated and control trees, predawn leaf water potential tended to be less negative in trees exposed to elevated [CO2]. Leaf longevity was greater in 2003 compared with the previous years, but the seasonal increase in stem basal area reached only about 75% of that in previous years. Our data suggest that the investigated tree species, particularly Q. petraea, did not experience severe water stress. However, an increased frequency of such exceptionally dry summers may have a more serious impact than a single event and would give Q. petraea a competitive advantage in the long run.},

  abstract = {Abstract Forests provide humankind with essential raw materials and the demand for these materials is increasing. Further expanding forestry into unmanaged forests is environmentally costly and increasing forest area via plantations will not immediately lead to increased wood supply. Thus, just like in agriculture, forestry faces the challenge how to intensify forest management in existing production forests in sustainable ways. Yet, our current understanding of what determines forest management intensity is weak, particularly at broad scales, and this makes it difficult to assess the environmental and social trade-offs of intensification. Here, we analyse spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity as one indicator for forest management intensity across Europe, a region where most forests suitable for production are already in use and where future intensification is likely. To measure forest harvesting intensity, we related harvested timber volumes to net annual increment for the period 2000–2010. We used boosted regression trees to analyse the spatial determinants of forest harvesting intensity using a comprehensive set of biophysical and socioeconomic explanatory variables. Our results show that forest harvesting intensity varied markedly across Europe and harvested timber volumes were well below the increment in most regions. Harvesting intensity was especially high in southern Finland, southern Sweden, southwestern France, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. The spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity were well explained by forest-resource related variables (i.e., the share of plantation species, growing stock, forest cover), site conditions (i.e., topography, accessibility), and country-specific characteristics, whereas socioeconomic variables were less important. We also found the relationship between forest harvesting intensity and some of its predictors (e.g., share of plantation species, accessibility) to be strongly non-linear and characterised by thresholds. In summary, our study highlights candidate areas where potentials for sustainably intensifying timber production may exist. Our analyses of the spatial determinants of harvesting intensity also provides concrete starting points for developing measures targeted at increasing regional wood supply from forests or lowering harvest pressure in regions where forests are heavily used. Finally, our study emphasises the importance for systems’ understanding for designing and implementing effective sustainable forest management policies.},

However, it is not clear which tree species will be able to cope with drier climatic conditions and higher year-to-year climatic variability. We analyzed tree-growth responses of five co-occurring conifer species to past climatic variations and severe droughts across a wide climatic gradient in Central Europe, covering four distinct biogeographic regions: the northern Swiss Alps, the Swiss Plateau, the foothills of the Jura Mountains and the dry Central Alps. We studied three native tree species (Larix decidua Mill, Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus sylvestris L.) and two non-native species (Pinus nigra Arn. and Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Tree-ring width was measured for 770 trees from 14 sites and species-specific site chronologies were established. Response-function analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), linear regressions and Superposed Epoch Analysis were used to assess the species-specific growth sensitivity to climate and severe drought along the gradient. Irrespective of the species and site conditions, high temperatures and low precipitation amounts in summer and autumn of the year prior growth significantly reduced tree growth. When evaporative demand, precipitation and soil water holding capacity were considered together, low water availability in current summer strongly reduced growth. Overall, the growth-climate relationships of the species were not or only slightly related to the site water balance per se. However, when all species-specific growth response coefficients were introduced into a PCA, a clear separation of the populations of the Central Alps (driest sites) became apparent. At these sites, soil water deficits in previous autumn and current spring strongly reduced radial growth, whereas at moist and wet sites on the Swiss Plateau, in the Jura Mountains and northern Alps summer drought impeded growth. Along the gradient, the native P. abies, L. decidua and P. sylvestris were the most sensitive species to drought, implying that their long-term performance and survival on nowadays dry sites can be compromised under a drier climate in Central Europe.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to find out if the great difference in behaviour between pedunculate oak and sessile oak in terms of decline (described previously) also appeared in terms of radial growth. and, if so, which ecological variables were concerned. One hundred seventy-three plots were chosen throughout an extensive area of France, covering a wide range of climatic and pedological conditions. The spatial distribution of pure stands of the two species is not random, which led us to assume that pedunculate oak has greater nutrient and water requirements than sessile oak. This was confirmed in the investigation of mixed high forest stands, where. on average, the radial growth of sessile oak is 46% higher than that of pedunculate oak. This gap is even wider, as local conditions of mineral nutrition and, more importantly, water supply worsen. Moreover, after an exceptional drought, the average difference is still greater for several years. On the other hand, sessile oak is more sensitive to low average temperatures during the growing season. Pedunculate oak has an advantage regarding some variables linked to wood quality (sapwood width and wood density), even if trees with the same diameter and average annual growth are compared. In order to improve the productivity of French oak forests in the area concerned, the main advice is to eliminate pedunculate oak in sites clearly unfavourable to the mineral nutrition and/or water supply of the trees. In less unfavourable sites, pedunculate oak may be retained. mainly in the coldest regions, but it should be grown in low density high forest. In intermediate conditions. the better wood properties of pedunculate oak could be taken into account when choosing the species to be favoured.},

  abstract = {Global climate change may be affecting forests around the world. However, the impact of climate change on forest population dynamics, especially at the landscape or regional level, has hardly been addressed before. A new methodology was proposed to enable matrix transition models to account for climate impact on forest population dynamics. The first climate-sensitive matrix (CSMatrix) model was developed for the Alaska boreal forest based on observations from over 15 years of forest inventory. The spatially explicit model was used to map climate-induced forest population dynamics across the region. The model predicted that the basal area increment in the region under natural succession would be hindered by global warming, more so for dry upland areas than for moist wetlands. It was suggested that temperature-induced drought stress could more than offset a predicted increase of future precipitation in the region to lower overall forest productivity. At the same time, stand diversity would increase across the region through transient species redistribution. Accounting for climate conditions made the CSMatrix model more accurate than conventional matrix models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Summary In the Mediterranean basin, precipitation is expected to decline by the end of the 21st century as a consequence of climate change. A throughfall exclusion experiment has been established in a Quercus ilex coppice in southern France to anticipate the response of this ecosystem to a reduced precipitation amount by removing part of the throughfall. The experiment involved four 140 m2 plots: a control plot, a throughfall exclusion plot, a thinned plot and a throughfall exclusion in a thinned plot. This experiment has been used during nearly two years to monitor throughfall amounts in the different plots. Additionally, stemflow has been recorded on 20 trees between 25 April 2006 and 15 May 2007. The control plot had a stem density of 6885 stems ha−1 and a leaf area index of 3.1, rainfall partitioning into interception loss, throughfall and stemflow was, respectively, 30.9%, 56.6% and 12.5% of the total precipitation (1605 mm over the study period). Thinning reduced the stem basal area by 33% and the total interception loss by 34.6%. Given the rainfall partitioning, the throughfall exclusion was found to remove 19% of total precipitation, which was confirmed by soil water content measurements. The revised Gash analytical model predicted interception with an agreement of −6.2% of total precipitation. Results show a good transferability of the model to a plot with a different stem density, thus supporting the idea that model parameters and evaporation from a wet canopy scale linearly with canopy cover.},

  abstract = {Aims The combined effects of changes in climate and land use on tree mortality and growth patterns have rarely been addressed. Relict tree species from the Mediterranean Basin serve as appropriate models to investigate these effects, since they grow in climatically stressed areas which have undergone intense cover changes. The aim is to use climate, aerial photographs, stand structure and radial-growth data to explain the mortality and historical patterns of growth of Abies pinsapo in the area where this relict species was first protected. Location Sierra de las Nieves, West Baetic Range, southern Spain. Methods We assessed variations of tree cover in A. pinsapo forests through image analyses of aerial photographs spanning the last 50 years. We sampled 31 stands to assess current altitudinal patterns of forest structure and mortality. We evaluated the relationships between radial growth and regional climate using linear models in three sites at different elevations. Results Regional warming and a decrease in precipitation were detected. Forest tree cover increased at all elevations from 1957 until 1991, but it afterwards decreased below 1100 m. Currently, the likelihood of tree mortality increases downwards and is associated with dense, closed stands with a low living basal area. In contrast to previous droughts, a sharp synchronized reduction in tree growth, not fully accounted for in linear climate-growth models, occurred at low elevations in 1994-95, but not upwards. It was preceded by a weakening of the negative association between low-elevation growth and water deficit since the late 1970s. Conclusions The intense densification of A. pinsapo forests following strict protection measures in the late 1950s enhanced the vulnerability of climate-sensitive A. pinsapo forests to recent drier conditions. Such abrupt land-use changes help to explain recent patterns of mortality and growth decline in low-elevation A. pinsapo forests.},

  abstract = {Radial growth and xylogenesis were studied to investigate the influence of climate variability and intraspecific competition on secondary growth in Abies pinsapo Boiss., a relic Mediterranean fir. We monitored the responses to three thinning treatments (unthinned control C, 30% T30 and 60% T60 of basal area removed) to test the hypothesis that they may improve the adaptation capacity of tree growth to climatic stress. We also assessed whether xylogenesis was differentially affected by tree-to-tree competition. Secondary growth was assessed using manual band dendrometers from 2005 to 2007. In 2006, xylogenesis (phases of tracheid formation) was also investigated by taking microcores and performing histological analyses. Seasonal dynamics of radial increment were modeled using Gompertz functions and correlations with microclimate and radiation were performed. Histological analyses revealed it as fundamental to calibrate the dendrometer estimates of radial increment and to establish the actual onset and end dates of tracheid production. The lower radial-increment rates and number of produced tracheids were observed in the trees subjected to high competition in the unthinned plots. The growing season differed among the plots, and its duration ranged from an average of 78days in unthinned plots to 115days in thinned ones (T60). Variations in the beginning of the growing season (13 April to 22 May) and earlywoodlatewood transition (early August) were mainly determined by the temperature pattern, while the onset and the end of the growing season were related to both annual precipitation and tree-to-tree competition. The tracheid-formation phases of radial enlargement and cell-wall thickening showed similar patterns in the trees from thinned and unthinned plots subjected to low and high competition, respectively, but the mean number of tracheids in each phase was always higher in the trees from the thinned plots. The reduction of competition through thinning induced a longer growing season and enhanced the radial growth in A. pinsapo.},

  abstract = {P>1. Long-term basal area increment (BAI) in Abies pinsapo was studied to investigate the way density-dependent factors modulate the responses of radial growth to climatic stresses in relict stands of a drought-sensitive Mediterranean fir. 2. First, we verified that spatially explicit competition predicts mean A. pinsapo BAI at our study site; i.e. it modulates the degree to which the average climate-driven potential for growth is expressed. Second, we verified that the long-term pattern of temperature predicts the long-term pattern of BAI, estimated as the main trend over a time period of c. 40 years. Finally, we assessed whether the intensity of tree-to-tree competition restrains the potential improvements achieved by our model of BAI when a short-term, high-frequency stressor such as drought (inter-annual precipitation variability) is introduced. 3. We applied Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) to characterize regional climatic trends and to test the hypothesis that trees subjected to contrasting competition intensity may differ in their growth pattern. Significant long-term climate trends obtained by DFA were used as predictors of long-term BAI. 4. The mean BAI was mainly determined by competition, whereas growth trends obtained by DFA did not differ among dominant, suppressed and dying trees. Common trends of growth decline were strongly related to long-term, late-winter to summer temperatures, while the residuals were related to total annual precipitation, although with decreasing significance as competition increased. Our results support the contention that the reported patterns of A. pinsapo growth decline and death occur as a result of the interacting effects of both competition and climate stressors acting at long- and short-term time scales. 5.Synthesis. Long-term climatic drought stress was the main driving factor of growth decline in A. pinsapo. Moreover, trees already suffering from competition (a long-term stress) were predisposed to decline given an additional short-term stress, such as a severe drought.},

  abstract = {The gas-exchange and radial growth responses of conifer forests to climatic warming and increasing atmospheric CO2 have been widely studied. However, the modulating effects of variables related to stand structure (e.g., tree-to-tree competition) on those responses are poorly explored. The basal-area increment (BAI) and C isotope discrimination (C stable isotope ratio; delta C-13) in the Mediterranean fir Abies pinsapo were investigated to elucidate the influences of stand competition, atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate on intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi). We assessed the variation in delta C-13 of tree-rings from dominant or co-dominant trees subjected to different degrees of competition. A high- (H) and a low-elevation (L) population with contrasting climatic constraints were studied in southern Spain. Both populations showed an increase in long-term WUEi. However, this increase occurred more slowly at the L site, where a decline of BAI was also observed. Local warming and severe droughts have occurred in the study area over the past 30 years, which have reduced water availability more at lower elevations. Contrastingly, trees from the H site were able to maintain high BAI values at a lower cost in terms of water consumption. In each population, trees subjected to a higher degree of competition by neighboring trees showed lower BAI and WUEi than those subjected to less competition, although the slopes of the temporal trends in WUEi were independent of the competitive micro-environment experienced by the trees. The results are consistent with an increasing drought-induced limitation of BAI and a decreasing rate of WUEi improvement in low-elevation A. pinsapo forests. This relict species might not be able to mitigate the negative effects of a decrease in water availability through a reduction in stomatal conductance, thus leading to a growth decline in the more xeric sites. An intense and poorly asymmetric competitive environment at the stand level may also act as an important constraint on the adaptive capacity of these drought-sensitive forests to climatic warming.},

  abstract = {The projected temperature rise, rainfall decrease and concentration of rainfall in extreme events could induce growth decline and die-off on tree populations located at the geographical distribution limit of the species. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in Mediterranean forests is not well developed and requires more focused research efforts. We studied the relationships between spatiotemporal patterns of temperature and precipitation along the southwestern edge of the Betic range (southern Spain) and measured basal area increment (BAI) and carbon isotope (Delta) in tree ring series of Abies pinsapo and Pinus halepensis, two Mediterranean conifer trees with contrasting drought adaptive capacity. Climatic information was obtained from a network covering a wide range of elevations and distances from the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Temperature trends were tested by the Mann-Kendall test, and precipitation was thoroughly analyzed by quantile regression. Climatic data showed a warming trend, enhanced since the 1970s, while quantile regressions revealed that drought events worsened during the course of the twentieth century. Long-term decrease of A. pinsapo BAI was related to regional warming and changing precipitation patterns, suggesting increasing drought stress on this species. Both temperature and precipitation in the summer influenced wood Delta in P. halepensis, whereas negative correlation between wood Delta and current autumn temperature was yielded for A. pinsapo. Increased intrinsic water use efficiency was inferred from wood Delta in both species; however, A. pinsapo showed sudden growth reductions under drier conditions, while pine trees were able to maintain almost constant BAI values and lower water costs under increasing long-term water stress.},

  abstract = {The understanding of regional vulnerability to climate change in Mediterranean mountain forests is not well developed. Climate change impacts on tree growth should be strongly related to the steep environmental gradients of mountainous areas, where a temperature-induced upward shift of the lower elevation limit is expected, particularly amongst drought-sensitive species. Trees will adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased extreme events such as prolonged drought. In this paper, we investigate the sub-regional temperature and precipitation trends and measure the basal area increment (BAI) in Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii (Dunal) Franco. Significant differences related to altitudinal and latitudinal gradients and stand-age structure were found in response to long-term trends in climate dryness. Old trees growing at higher elevations showed similar extreme drought sensitivity but maintained almost steady BAI. Declining BAI found in trees at lower elevations and drier sites may imply a higher vulnerability to temperature-induced drought stress, suggesting an impending growth decline and an enhanced die-off risk. Our results illustrate how the effects of long-term warming and short-term drought on tree BAI are influenced by both site conditions and mean stand age in a drought-sensitive Mediterranean pine.},

  abstract = {Within-range effects of climatic change on tree growth at the sub-regional scale remain poorly understood. The aim of this research was to use climate and radial-growth data to explain how long-term climatic trends affect tree growth patterns along the southern limit of the range of Pinus nigra ssp. salzmannii (Eastern Baetic Range, southern Spain). We used regional temperature and precipitation data and measured sub-regional radial growth variation in P. nigra forests over the past two centuries. A dynamic factor analysis was applied to test the hypothesis that trees subjected to different climates have experienced contrasting long-term growth variability. We defined four representative stand types based on average temperature and precipitation to evaluate climate-growth relationships using linear mixed-effect models and multi-model selection criteria. All four stand types experienced warming and declining precipitation throughout the twentieth century. From the onset of the twentieth century, synchronised basal-area increment decline was accounted for by dynamic factor analysis and was related to drought by climate-growth models; declining basal-area increment trends proved stronger at lower elevations, whereas temperature was positively related to growth in areas with high rainfall inputs. Given the contrasting sub-regional tree-growth responses to climate change, the role of drought becomes even more complex in shaping communities and affecting selection pressure in the Mediterranean mountain forests. Potential vegetation shifts will likely occur over the dry edge of species distributions, with major impacts on ecosystem structure and function.},

  abstract = {Leadbeater’s possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) is an arboreal marsupial that occurs primarily in the montane ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria. Leadbeater’s possum is among the best studied endangered species globally. Despite extensive monitoring and research, the ongoing population trajectory of the species has resulted in its recent upgrading from Endangered to Critically Endangered. One of the key processes threatening the species is the widespread use of clearfell logging, which significantly degrades the habitat of the species and results in long-term habitat loss, fragmented populations, and an elevated risk of high-severity crown-scorching fires. A general principle underpinning conservation biology is to remove key threatening processes to enhance the conservation of species. The cessation of clearfell logging and a major expansion of the reserve system are urgently needed to limit the risk of extinction of Leadbeater’s possum. Current government policies and practices that continue to result in clearfelling of montane ash forests run counter to the large body of science indicating what is needed to conserve Leadbeater’s possum. A large ecological reserve is urgently required to maximise the chances that the species will persist in the wild.},

  abstract = {Aim Trees are often observed to get shorter and more narrowly crowned in dry regions and at high elevations. We explore how this pattern is driven by two opposing factors: competition for light makes it advantageous to extend branches to their biomechanical limit, whereas under cold or arid conditions it is advantageous to have shorter branches, thereby reducing the length of the hydraulic transport system and embolism risk. Using data from 700,000 trees of 26 species, we quantify how environmental conditions influence the scaling of height and crown diameter (CD) with stem diameter (d.b.h.). We compare our predictions with those of metabolic scaling theory (MST), which suggests that allometry is invariant of environment. Location 48,000 inventory plots that systematically sample mainland Spain, a region in which climate varies strongly. Methods We fit d.b.h.height and d.b.h.CD functions using Bayesian methods, allowing comparison of within- and across-species trends in allometry along gradients of temperature, precipitation, drought and competition for light (i.e. the basal area of taller trees). Results The competitive environment had a strong influence on aboveground allometry, but all trees were far shorter than predicted by biomechanical models, suggesting that factors other than biomechanics are important. Species that dominate in arid and cold habitats were much shorter (for a given diameter) than those from benign conditions; but within-species heights did not vary strongly across climatic gradients. Main conclusions Our results do not support the MST prediction that d.b.h.height and d.b.h.CD allometries are invariant, or that biomechanical constraints determine height allometry. Rather, we highlight the role of hydraulic limitations in this region. The fact that intra-specific adjustment in d.b.h.CD height allometry along environmental gradients was far weaker than across-species changes may indicate genetic constraints on allometry which might contribute to niche differentiation among species.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal or hierarchical data are often observed in forestry, which can pose both challenges and opportunities when performing statistical analyses. The current standard approach for analysing these types of data is mixed-effects models under the frequentist paradigm. Bayesian techniques have several advantages when compared with traditional approaches, but their use in forestry has been relatively limited. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian solution to non-linear mixed-effects models for longitudinal data in forestry. We demonstrate the Bayesian modelling process using individual tree height–age data for balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.)) collected from eastern Maine. Due to its frequent utilization in modelling dominant tree height growth over time, we choose to examine models based on the Chapman–Richards function. We established four different model formulations, each having varying subject-specific parameters, which we estimated using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. We found the estimation results to be quite close between the two methods. In addition, an important feature of the Bayesian method is the unified manner in which estimation and prediction are handled. Specifically, local parameters can be predicted for a new dataset after setting the posterior distributions from the estimation stage as new priors in the prediction phase.},

  abstract = {Climatic change is likely to affect Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests in several important ways. In this paper, we address the role of climate in four forest ecosystem processes and project the effects of future climatic change on these processes across Washington State. First, we relate Douglas-fir growth to climatic limitation and suggest that where Douglas-fir is currently water-limited, growth is likely to decline due to increased summer water deficit. Second, we use existing analyses of climatic controls on tree species biogeography to demonstrate that by the mid twenty-first century, climate will be less suitable for key species in some areas of Washington. Third, we examine the relationships between climate and the area burned by fire and project climatically driven regional and sub-regional increases in area burned. Fourth, we suggest that climatic change influences mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks by increasing host-tree vulnerability and by shifting the region of climate suitability upward in elevation. The increased rates of disturbance by fire and mountain pine beetle are likely to be more significant agents of changes in forests in the twenty-first century than species turnover or declines in productivity, suggesting that understanding future disturbance regimes is critical for successful adaptation to climate change.},

  abstract = {Borrowing from landscape ecology, atmospheric science, and integrated assessment, we aim to understand the complex interactions that determine productivity in montane forests and utilize such relationships to forecast montane forest vulnerability under global climate change. Specifically, we identify, relationships for precipitation and temperature that govern the spatiotemporal variability in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) growth by seeking similarities in patterns of growth/climate models across a significant portion of the climatological range of the species. In the 21(st) century and beyond, sustainable forestry will depend on successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change and climate variability on forest structure and function. The combination of these foci will allow improved prediction of the fate of montane forests over a wide range of biogeoclimatic conditions in western North America and thus allow improved management strategies for adapting to climate change. We describe a multi-disciplinary strategy for analyzing growth variability as a function of climate over a broad range of local-to-regional influences and demonstrate the efficacy of this sampling method in defining regional gradients of growth-limiting factors.},

  abstract = {Developing appropriate management options for adapting to climate change is a new challenge for land managers, and integration of climate change concepts into operational management and planning on United States national forests is just starting. We established science-management partnerships on the Olympic National Forest (Washington) and Tahoe National Forest (California) in the first effort to develop adaptation options for specific national forests. We employed a focus group process in order to establish the scientific context necessary for understanding climate change and its anticipated effects, and to develop specific options for adapting to a warmer climate. Climate change scientists provided the scientific knowledge base on which adaptations could be based, and resource managers developed adaptation options based on their understanding of ecosystem structure, function, and management. General adaptation strategies developed by national forest managers include: (1) reduce vulnerability to anticipated climate-induced stress by increasing resilience at large spatial scales, (2) consider tradeoffs and conflicts that may affect adaptation success, (3) manage for realistic outcomes and prioritize treatments that facilitate adaptation to a warmer climate, (4) manage dynamically and experimentally, and (5) manage for structure and composition. Specific adaptation options include: (1) increase landscape diversity, (2) maintain biological diversity, (3) implement early detection/rapid response for exotic species and undesirable resource conditions, (4) treat large-scale disturbance as a management opportunity and integrate it in planning, (5) implement treatments that confer resilience at large spatial scales, (6) match engineering of infrastructure to expected future conditions, (7) promote education and awareness about climate change among resource staff and local publics, and (8) collaborate with a variety of partners on adaptation strategies and to promote ecoregional management. The process described here can quickly elicit a large amount of information relevant for adaptation to climate change, and can be emulated for other national forests, groups of national forests with similar resources, and other public lands. As adaptation options are iteratively generated for additional administrative units on public lands, management options can be compared, tested, and integrated into adaptive management. Science-based adaptation is imperative because increasing certainty about climate impacts and management outcomes may take decades.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this work is to understand the nature of growth - climate relationships for Douglas-. r ( Pseudotsuga menziesii) across the climatic dimensions of its niche. We used a combination of biophysically informed sampling ( to identify sample sites) and dendroclimatology ( to identify growth - climate relationships) along a climate gradient in northwestern United States mountain ecosystems from the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington to the eastern Rocky Mountain Front, Montana. We used a multi- scale sampling strategy that accounted for continentality, physiography, and topography as non- climatic factors that could in. uence climate and alter tree growth. We developed a network of 124 Douglas-. r tree- ring chronologies and explored growth - climate correlations across the sampled gradients. We considered two different spatial scales of monthly and seasonal climate variables as potential controlling factors on tree growth. Annual radial growth in 60 - 65% of the plots across the region is signi. cantly correlated with precipitation, drought, or water balance during the late summer prior to growth and the early summer the year of growth. In a few plots, growth is positively correlated with cool- season temperature or negatively correlated with snowpack. Water availability is therefore more commonly limiting to Douglas-. r growth than energy limitations on growing season length. The. rst principal component derived from the chronologies is signi. cantly correlated with independent drought reconstructions. The sensitivity of Douglas-. r to summer water balance de. cit ( potential evapotranspiration minus actual evapotranspiration) indicates that increases in April to September temperature without increases in summer precipitation or soil moisture reserves are likely to cause decreases in growth over much of the sampled area, especially east of the Cascade crest. In contrast, Douglas-. r may exhibit growth increases at some higher elevation sites where seasonal photosynthesis is currently limited by growing- season length or low growing- season temperature. Life- history processes such as establishment, growth, and mortality are precursors to changes in biogeography, and measurements of climate effects on those processes can provide early indications of climate- change effects on ecosystems.},

Fire potential is measured by the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), which is calculated using the observed maximum temperature and precipitation and projected changes at the end of this century (2070–2100) by general circulation models (GCMs) for present and future climate conditions, respectively. It is shown that future wildfire potential increases significantly in the United States, South America, central Asia, southern Europe, southern Africa, and Australia. Fire potential moves up by one level in these regions, from currently low to future moderate potential or from moderate to high potential. Relative changes are the largest and smallest in southern Europe and Australia, respectively. The period with the KBDI greater than 400 (a simple definition for fire season in this study) becomes a few months longer. The increased fire potential is mainly caused by warming in the U.S., South America, and Australia and by the combination of warming and drying in the other regions. Sensitivity analysis shows that future fire potential depends on many factors such as climate model and emission scenario used for climate change projection. The results suggest dramatic increases in wildfire potential that will require increased future resources and management efforts for disaster prevention and recovery.},

  abstract = {Recent world-wide episodes of tree dieback have been attributed to increasing temperatures and associated drought. Because these events are likely to become more common, improved knowledge of their cumulative effects on resilience and the ability to recover pre-disturbance conditions is important for forest management. Here we propose several indices to examine components of individual tree resilience based on tree ring growth: resistance (inverse of growth reduction during the episode), recovery (growth increase relative to the minimum growth during the episode), resilience (capacity to reach pre-episode growth levels) and relative resilience (resilience weighted by the damage incurred during the episode). Based on tree ring analyses, we analyzed historical patterns of tree resilience to successive drought-induced low growth periods in ponderosa pine trees growing in unmanaged, remote forests of the Rocky Mountains. Low-growth periods registered in tree rings were related to anomalies in the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and were attributed to drought. Independently of the impact of a specific event, subsequent growth after a single low-growth episode was related to the growth prior to the event. Growth performance differed with tree age: young trees were overall more resistant to low-growth periods, but older trees recovered better from more recent events. Regardless of tree age, recently burned sites exhibited lower post-episode growth and lower resistance and resilience than unburned ones. We found mixed evidence for the cumulative effect of past low-growth episodes: overall, greater impacts of a prior event and greater cumulative effects of past low-growth periods caused a decrease in resistance. However, we did not find a progressive decrease in resilience over time in old trees. Our results highlight the value of using a combination of estimators to evaluate the different components of resilience. Specifically, while tree responses to disturbance depend on past disturbance episodes, the response is context-specific and depends on the impact the capacity to recover after disturbance. This suggests that recent increases in forest mortality under current climate trends could relate to thresholds on specific components of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience itself) rather than to an overall loss of resilience over time. Identifying such thresholds and their underlying mechanisms is a promising area of research with important implications for forest management.},

  abstract = {We investigated the climate response of three Siberian taiga species, Larix cajanderi, Picea obovata, and Pinus sylvestris, across a latitudinal gradient in central Siberia. We hypothesized that warming is more frequently associated with increased growth for evergreen conifers (P. obovata and P. sylvestris) than for L. cajanderi, and for northern than for southern sites; we also hypothesized that increased growth is associated with a positive trend in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In mixed stands, growth of L. cajanderi and P. obovata increased over time, but the larger growth increases in P. obovata may presage a shift in competitive balance between these species. Climate response varied among and within populations of all species, and positive responses to temperature prevailed at northern sites, where trees grew faster in years with warm early summers. Negative responses to warming declined along the south to north latitudinal gradient. We observed considerable variability in climate response within populations which even exceeded that among species or sites. Tree response to climate was correlated with NDVI trends, indicating that patterns of tree-growth response to climate were indicative of a coherent landscape-scale response to warming. Our findings suggest that increased productivity with warming is likely only in the northern reaches of the Siberian taiga. An increased prevalence of evergreen conifers in areas currently dominated by deciduous Larix species also seems likely.},

  abstract = {Climate is a main driving factor of the formation of annual tree-rings, but which climatic variables are the most influential on radial growth may vary among species and sites. To explore these interactions, tree-ring chronologies along a major elevation gradient were examined for three tree species in southern interior British Columbia (Canada): Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus contorta, and Picea glauca x engelmannii. We used correlations and linear and multiple regressions to explore the relationships between tree-ring radial growth and climate variables in the area from 1922 to 1997. All correlation coefficients between ring chronologies and monthly climatic variables were medium to low (from -0.3 to 0.4); nevertheless, moderate but significant trends could be identified. Multivariate models explained up to 53%, 43% and 32% of radial growth variability for A contorta, A menziesii and P. glauca x engelmannii, respectively. All three species showed similar radial growth-climate patterns across the elevational gradient, but they had different details that made ring width-climate relationships species-specific. Precipitation-related variables were more related to radial growth at low-elevations, changing into temperature-related variables at high-elevations. Tree-ring width for all three species was primarily and significantly affected by climate variables from the year previous to the growing season and only secondly by current year conditions, but the critical months varied for different species and altitudes. Winter precipitation also affected radial growth, either as a source of water or as a possible agent of physical damage. Although our work showed significant climate influences on breast height tree radial growth, our results also indicated that other site factors such as microclimate or stand dynamics can be as or more important than climate variability.

  abstract = {Past simulation studies using a variety of models have generally agreed that climatic warming could have adverse effects on forests, including large-scale diebacks in some regions and drastic range shrinkages of many species. These effects should be most evident at biome transition zones. Other studies have pointed out, however, that past models have used a parabolic temperature response function that is based on geographic range limits rather than functional responses or data and that this parabolic model could exaggerate dieback effects. A new model is proposed for growing degree-days temperature response, which is asymptotic rather than parabolic. In this new model, tree height growth rate increases and then levels off with increasing growing degree-days. Species from more southern regions have a higher asymptote. It is shown that this model can be derived from the integration of a parabolic growth response to temperature over a year-long sinusoidal temperature regime. The SORTIE forest simulation model was modified to incorporate this response function. An ecotonal region was simulated under a warming scenario. The traditional parabolic temperature response model produced a wide zone of dieback following warming. In contrast, the new asymptotic response function produced no dieback and a stable ecotone that migrated north at < 100 m/100 years.},

  abstract = {1. Control theory is a well-developed branch of mathematics and engineering that identifies optimal control policies for dynamic systems. While it should be useful for managing ecosystems, it is currently used only in certain fields of ecology and resource management, and only certain aspects of the theory are applied. Where optimal control policies have been determined, such as oceanic fisheries, the control policy often fails. 2. The goals of this study were to determine why control theory has not been used very much and why it fails, and also to improve its applicability to natural resource management. Control theory methods and assumptions were reviewed, and applications to agriculture, forestry and fisheries summarized. A comparison was made between control theory assumptions and the real ecological systems to which the method was applied. A fisheries example was developed to illustrate some improvements to the application of this technique. 3. It was shown that the paradoxical aspects of control theory in resource management result from the points of divergence of real systems from the assumptions of control theory. Because of non-linearities, noise, sampling difficulties, policy implementation error and other issues, ecosystems are neither readily observable nor easily controllable. This means that even theoretically correct control policies can lead to failure. 4. The fisheries example showed that measurement error and management lags can of themselves lead to the collapse of a fishery. It was shown that the costs of acquiring information and managing the system need to be incorporated explicitly into the control problem as decision variables. The solution to the fisheries control problem prevented extinction of the fishery by reducing sampling error and management lags to reasonable but non-zero levels. 5. Other suggestions are made for applying control theory with more success. By taking into account the deviations between the idealized control model and real systems, better resource management can be achieved. Control theory could also profitably be applied to the design of monitoring programmes, to model parameter estimation, and to other aspects of ecology and resource management where it is currently not being utilized. 6. Synthesis and applications. Control theory needs to be re-evaluated for its utility in natural resource management. It offers the potential for providing effective management policies. To achieve this potential, techniques borrowed from engineering must be expanded to incorporate the effects of state uncertainty (measurement error), environmental fluctuations (stochasticity), parameter uncertainty and policy implementation error.},

  abstract = {Tree rings provide a primary data source for reconstructing past climates, particularly over the past 1,000 years. However, divergence has been observed in twentieth century reconstructions. Divergence occurs when trees show a positive response to warming in the calibration period but a lesser or even negative response in recent decades. The mathematical implications of divergence for reconstructing climate are explored in this study. Divergence results either because of some unique environmental factor in recent decades, because trees reach an asymptotic maximum growth rate at some temperature, or because higher temperatures reduce tree growth. If trees show a nonlinear growth response, the result is to potentially truncate any historical temperatures higher than those in the calibration period, as well as to reduce the mean and range of reconstructed values compared to actual. This produces the divergence effect. This creates a cold bias in the reconstructed record and makes it impossible to make any statements about how warm recent decades are compared to historical periods. Some suggestions are made to overcome these problems.},

  abstract = {This journal concerns itself with ecological complexity and theoretical ecology. In order to study complex systems it is often necessary to make categorizations, simplifying assumptions and analogies, and to use particular model structures and statistical tools. Such operations on the raw sensory data of nature may or may not be valid, and can make it difficult to evaluate the validity of a study. In this viewpoint article, I illustrate how ill-posed questions can confound the study of complex ecological systems. I offer several suggestions for overcoming this particular difficulty. Ill-posed questions are questions for which there are either no answers or only ambiguous (non-unique) answers. It is suggested that ill-posed questions are a particular problem in Ecology. Several types of ill-posed questions are discussed. Unobservable and uncountable phenomena (e.g., What happened before the Big Bang? How many stars are there?) are pervasive in Ecology because of the spatially and temporally diffuse interactions that characterize ecological systems. Vague terminology creates ill-posed discourse because different people use "fragmentation" or "niche" in different ways. Untestable theories are a common problem. Theories may be untestable because the objects of the theory are idealized and cannot be related to the real world, because terminology is vague, or for other reasons. Divergent metrics create ill-posed measurement problems. For example, many real world objects approximate fractal objects, at least at some scales, but they may be measured with an arbitrary length scale which differs between different studies. This means that metrics and conclusions from different studies are not comparable. Inconsistent classification systems are an issue. For example, map classifications lose rare habitat types when larger scale maps are created and thus habitat diversity metrics change with different levels of map resolution. Finally, statistical ill-posedness is a problem. This arises when the statistical test does not test or prove what it is thought to. A review of a selection of literature is used to illustrate the issues raised. Suggestions are offered for recognizing and dealing with ill-posed questions in Ecology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {There is concern about the potential impacts of climate change on species and ecosystems. To address this concern, a large body of literature has developed in which these impacts are assessed. In this study, criteria for conducting reliable and useful assessments of impacts of future climate are suggested. The major decisions involve: clearly defining an emissions scenario; selecting a climate model; evaluating climate model skill and bias; quantifying General Circulation Model (GCM) between-model variability; selecting an ecosystem model and assessing uncertainty; properly considering transient versus equilibrium responses; including effects of CO(2) on plant response; evaluating implications of simplifying assumptions; and considering animal linkage with vegetation. A sample of the literature was surveyed in light of these criteria. Many of the studies used climate simulations that were >10 years old and not representative of best current models. Future effects of elevated CO(2) on plant drought resistance and productivity were generally included in growth model studies but not in niche (habitat suitability) studies, causing the latter to forecast greater future adverse impacts. Overly simplified spatial representation was frequent and caused the existence of refugia to be underestimated. Few studies compared multiple climate simulations and ecosystem models (including parametric uncertainty), leading to a false impression of precision and potentially arbitrary results due to high between-model variance. No study assessed climate model retrodictive skill or bias. Overall, most current studies fail to meet all of the proposed criteria. Suggestions for improving assessments are provided.},

The same attributes that result in an insect herbivore being termed a ?pest? predispose it to disruption by climate change, particularly global warming. Although many pest species have co-evolved relationships with forest hosts that may or may not be harmful over the long term, the effects on these relationships may have disastrous consequences. We consider both the data and models necessary to evaluate the impacts of climate change, as well as the assessments that have been made to date. The results indicate that all aspects of insect outbreak behavior will intensify as the climate warms. This reinforces the need for more detailed monitoring and evaluations as climatic events unfold. Luckily, we are well placed to make rapid progress, using software tools, databases, and the models that are already available.},

It has been described as one of the more general principles of plant population biology, but the evidence supporting it has recently come under close scrutiny. Recent reevaluations have concluded that the slope is much more variable than previous authors have claimed, that straight lines are the exception rather than the rule, and that the slope varies with aspects of the biology of the plant. Using a range of statistical techniques, I examined the published evidence to test the strength of these conclusions. Much of the recently reported variability in slope has resulted from the inclusion of inappropriate data sets: not all populations for which biomass and density data are available are undergoing self-thinning. I also found that there was no evidence for relationships between shade tolerance or taxonomic groups and the slope, and that the reported relationships between the slope and various allometric growth constants, though real, were weak. The combined data for all populations are not consistent with an interspecific relationship of slope -1/2, the slope being somewhat shallower, at -0.379, possibly because only the stem mass of trees is generally measured. I conclude that there is no evidence at present for a -1/2 power rule of self-thinning, but that final rejection of the idea that there is an ideal slope (which may or may not be -1/2), awaits experiments in which resource levels are carefully controlled.},

Bayesian calibrations allow both model structure and parameters to be assessed simultaneously in a probabilistic framework, providing a model with which forecasts and their uncertainty can be better understood and quantified using posterior probability distributions. A Bayesian calibration of a stand-level dynamic growth (SLeDG) model is carried out for both Sitka spruce and Scots pine in the UK for the first time. The calibration used the differential evolution Markov-Chain method to reduce the required number of iterations for inference. Two different model structures were considered for estimating local stand productivity: one using the measured height–age relationship, and one using estimated site yield class. The height–age relationship was shown to be more probable for both species in a Bayesian model comparison (total model probability$=$0.64 and 0.58 for Sitka spruce and Scots pine, respectively), although metrics of model performance were similar for both model structures ($R^2 \geq 0.88$ in all variables). A complete calibration (using all data) of the more probable model structure was then completed, and excellent model fit was observed ($R^2 >0.95$ for all variables in both species). Example forecasts using the output from the calibration were demonstrated, and are compatible with existing yield tables for both species. This method could be applied to other species or other model structures in the future.},

However, these relationships are very costly to obtain, as the data on which they are based require laborious destructive sampling. In addition, allometric coefficients appear to change for a given species depending on stand density, site and season (recent weather conditions). Thus, if the environmental conditions change, these relationships may not be valid. This study attempts to explain why allometric relationships may vary in time and from site to site by using a little set of known bioclimatic variables. Seventy-eight trees from three sites and eight dates were selected for destructive sampling. Dendrometric variables were obtained from stem analysis. Leaf area and leaf biomass were estimated using ratio estimators in stratified random sampling. The allometric relationships varied depending on the site and date. Relationships involving variables that accumulate during the life-span of a tree (biomass, volume and height of stem versus diameter at breast height) depend mainly on site and little on recent weather conditions. In contrast, those regarding variables that were not totally cumulative (leaf and branch biomass and leaf area versus diameter at breast height) varied mostly with recent weather conditions. Bioclimatic variables have proved to be both a meaningful and easy tool to use to produce a parameterisation of all the allometric relationships, which could be very useful to obtain transition and output functions in growth modelling.},

  abstract = {Community ecology and ecosystem ecology provide two perspectives on complex ecological systems that have largely complementary strengths and weaknesses. Merging the two perspectives is necessary both to ensure continued scientific progress and to provide society with the scientific means to face growing environmental challenges. Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines. Recent community evolution models are a promising step in that direction.},

  abstract = {Climate is a critical factor affecting forest ecosystems and their capacity to produce goods and services. This chapter reviews published studies of climate-forest relationships with emphasis on indications and mechanisms of change during recent decades. Effects of climate change on forests depend on ecosystem-specific factors including human activities, natural processes, and several dimensions of climate (temperature, drought, wind, etc.). Indications of recent climate-related changes in ecosystem processes are stronger in boreal forests than in other domains. In contrast, constraints on adaptive capacity that increase vulnerability to climate change are generally more severe in subtropical and tropical forests than in temperate and boreal domains. Available information is not sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the ecological, social and economic consequences of recent forest responses to human influences on climate. The complexity of natural and human systems is a formidable barrier to impact quantification and predictability. For example, effects of land use practices and invasive species can overshadow and interact with effects of climate change. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made in defining mechanisms of climate-change impacts on forest ecosystems. Knowledge of impact mechanisms enables identification and mitigation of some of the conditions that increase vulnerability to climate change in the forest sector.},

  abstract = {The climate sensitivity of radial growth in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) was analyzed within a narrow valley in the Swabian Alb (southwestern Germany). We collected stem disks from three aspects (NE, NW and SW) of trees belonging to different social classes. Common climatic factors limiting growth across the valley were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA). Further, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and bootstrapped correlation analysis to reveal differences in chronologies and climate-growth relationships between aspect and social class. Climatic variables considered in our analyses were monthly and seasonal data on temperature and precipitation, as well as a self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). We identified drought in the period June-August as the most prominent factor limiting growth across the valley. Dominant and co-dominant trees at the NW and SW aspects were found to be particularly drought sensitive, whereas intermediate trees were less susceptible to drought. Underlying causes of established climate-growth relationships are discussed in the context of drought susceptibility, tree-size modulation and tree physiological processes.},

This assumption allows for the use of dominant tree height as an index of site quality. We found that this assumption was false for the seven tallest trees in 184 even-aged loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands, planted at nine initial planting densities, at four different geographic locations. A strong, highly significant negative correlation was found between dominant height and initial planting density for stands 14 and 16 years of age. This leads to large differences in predicted site index for stands with different initial planting densities planted at the same geographic location. Use of these site indices to predict yield produced large differences in predicted yield (m(3)/ha) at age 25. These results provide strong evidence for density-dependent height growth, even for dominant trees in the stand, and suggest that site index, used as a measurement of site quality, is confounded with stand density.},

  abstract = {Tree populations located at the geographical distribution limit of the species may provide valuable information about the response of tree growth to climate warming across climatic gradients. Dendroclimatic information was extracted from a network of 10 silver-fir (Abies alba) populations in the south-western distribution limit of the species (Pyrenees, NE Iberian Peninsula). Ring-width chronologies were built for five stands sampled in mesic sites from the Main Range in the Pyrenees, and for five forests located in the southern Peripheral Ranges where summer drought is more pronounced. The radial growth of silver-fir in this region is constrained by water stress during the summer previous to growth, as suggested by the negative relationship with previous September temperature and, to a lesser degree, by a positive relationship with previous end of summer precipitation. Climatic data showed a warming trend since the 1970s across the Pyrenees, with more severe summer droughts. The recent warming changed the climate-growth relationships, causing higher growth synchrony among sites, and a higher year-to-year growth variation, especially in the southernmost forests. Moving-interval response functions suggested an increasing water-stress effect on radial growth during the last half of the 20th century. The growth period under water stress has extended from summer up to early autumn. Forests located in the southern Peripheral Ranges experienced a more intense water stress, as seen in a shift of their response to precipitation and temperature. The Main-Range sites mainly showed a response to warming. The intensification of water-stress during the late 20th century might affect the future growth performance of the highly-fragmented A. alba populations in the southwestern distribution limit of the species.},

The current state of the art of process modeling is discussed in the context of forest ecosystem management. We argue that the carbon balance approach is readily applicable for projecting forest yield and productivity, and review several carbon balance models for estimating stand productivity and individual tree growth and competition. We propose that to develop operational models, it is necessary to accept that all models may have both empirical and causal components at the system level. We present examples of hybrid carbon balance models and consider issues that currently require incorporation of empirical information at the system level. We review model calibration and validation methods that take account of the hybrid character of models.The operational implementation of process-based models to practical forest management is discussed. Methods of decision-making in forest management are gradually moving toward a more general, analytical approach, and it seems likely that models that include some process-oriented components will soon be used in forestry enterprises. This development is likely to run parallel with the further development of ecophysiologically based models.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the height growth of open-grown trees as a compromise between reducing self-shading by decreasing foliage density, and reducing structural costs by controlling crown dimensions. Self-shading is described with an equation which accounts for the reduction of foliage-specific photosynthesis due to increased volume density of foliage. Tree growth is described using a differential equation based on the carbon balance, where allocation of growth between wood and foliage follows the pipe-model theory. Crown shape is constant and crown length is equal to tree height. In this model, the construction and maintenance costs of wood relative to photosynthetic production increase with decreasing foliage density in the crown. The main result is that optimal height growth for maximizing accumulated net production is a bell-shaped function of time and rather independent of parameter values. As a result of optimal height growth, foliage biomass follows an allometric function of tree height. The allometric exponent is in the range 2–3, depending on the environmental parameters. The model is most sensitive to the fertility of the growth site, such that fertile sites favour low values and poor sites high values of the exponent. The results are compared with Scots pine and red pine trees grown in the open. The empirical material is consistent with the model.},

Karst.) were investigated in long-term thinning experiments on mineral soil sites in southern Finland. The measurement period was on average 27 years, and the intensity of the thinnings from below ranged from heavy thinning (45 per cent of basal area removed) to no thinning. Total stem volume increment and merchantable volume produced per hectare were the highest on the unthinned plots, but light and moderate thinning (<30 per cent removed) produced almost as much. Heavy thinning (>30 per cent removed) reduced the volume increment by about 10 per cent. However, a part of the total production of unthinned plots was lost through natural mortality. On the thinned plots, natural mortality was considerably lower compared with the unthinned plots. The average diameter increment of all the trees, as well as the diameter of the largest trees, clearly increased with increasing thinning intensity. In contrast, dominant height increment was not affected by thinning. The stand age at the time of establishment of the experiments had no major effect on the growth reactions after thinning. Thus, heavy thinning results in earlier thinning yields and a higher proportion of larger-sized stems at the expense of a somewhat lower total yield.},

  abstract = {1. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the frequency of facilitative and competitive interactions will vary inversely across abiotic stress gradients, with facilitation being more common in conditions of high abiotic stress relative to more benign abiotic conditions. With notable exceptions, most tests of the SGH have studied the interaction between a single pair or a few pairs of species, and thus have evaluated shifts in the magnitude and direction of pair-wise interactions along stress gradients, rather than shifts in the general frequency of interactions. 2. The SGH has been supported by numerous studies in many ecosystems, has provided a crucial foundation for studying the interplay between facilitation and competition in plant communities, and has a high heuristic value. However, recent empirical research indicates that factors like the variation among species and the nature of the stress gradient studied add complexity not considered in the SGH, creating an opportunity to extend the SGH's general conceptual framework. 3. We suggest that one approach for extending the SGH framework is to differentiate between the original idea of how 'common' interactions might be along stress gradients and the ubiquitous empirical approach of studying shifts in the strength of pair-wise interactions. Furthermore, by explicitly considering the life history of the interacting species (relative tolerance to stress vs. competitive ability) and the characteristics of the stress factor (resource vs. non-resource) we may be able to greatly refine specific predictions relevant to the SGH. 4. We propose that the general pattern predicted by the SGH would hold more frequently for some combinations of life histories and stress factor, particularly when the benefactor and beneficiary species are mostly competitive and stress-tolerant, respectively. However, we also predict that other combinations are likely to yield different results. For example, the effect of neighbours can be negative at both ends of the stress gradient when both interacting species have similar 'competitive' or 'stress-tolerant' life histories and the abiotic stress gradient is driven by a resource (e. g. water). 5. Synthesis. The extension of the SGH presented here provides specific and testable hypotheses to foster research and helps to reconcile potential discrepancies among previous studies. It represents an important step in incorporating the complexity and species-specificity of potential outcomes into models and theories addressing how plant-plant interactions change along stress gradients.},

  abstract = {Changes in climate are predicted to significantly affect the productivity of trees in the Great Lakes region over the next century. Forest management decisions, such as initial stand density, can promote climatic resiliency and moderate decreased productivity through the reduction of tree competition. The influences of climate (temperature and precipitation) and forest management (initial stand density) on the productivity of red pine (Pinus resinosa) across multiple sites within Huron National Forest, Michigan, were examined using dendrochronological methods. Two common planting regimes were compared in this analysis; low initial density (<988 trees per hectare) and high initial density (>1977 trees per hectare). Low initial density stands were found to have a higher climatic resilience by combining equal or greater measures of productivity, while having a reduced sensitivity to monthly and seasonal climate, particularly to summer drought.},

  abstract = {The ability of plants to supply water to their leaves is intimately associated with survival. Water supply to leaves depends on maintaining an intact water column in the xylem from the roots to shoots. Because this hydraulic pathway is under tension, it is vulnerable to breakage through the induction of air emboli (cavitation). Although the physiological benefit of resistance to water-stress-induced xylem cavitation for desiccation tolerance is clear, there is considerable interspecific variation within and across climates. To understand the adaptive significance of this variation and the potential trade-off with water transport, we compiled a database of 167 species from 50 seed plant families and examined relationships among resistance to xylem cavitation, water transport capacity (as determined by the specific conductivity of xylem [KS]), and climate. Relationships were evaluated using standard cross-species correlations (r). Because inferences about the adaptive significance of these correlations can be biased by the potential similarity of closely related species, we also analyzed our data using phylogenetically independent contrast correlations (PIC) calculated over a range of alternate seed plant phylogenies. Resistance to cavitation, expressed as the xylem tension at which 50% of hydraulic conductivity was lost (?50), ranged from ?0.18 to ?9.9 MPa for angiosperms and from ?1.5 to ?14.1 MPa for conifers. Conifers were most resistant to cavitation, with mean ?50 80% more negative than angiosperms. In contrast, KS was 270% higher in angiosperms than conifers. Across all species, cavitation resistance increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation. However, significant phylogenetically independent contrast correlations between ?50 and annual precipitation were found within the evergreen angiosperms and conifers but not in the deciduous angiosperms. Thus, the adaptive significance of increased resistance to cavitation as a mechanism of drought tolerance may be of primary importance in evergreen angiosperms and conifers. In contrast, analysis of independent contrasts indicated that KS increased with decreasing rainfall in deciduous angiosperms, whereas there was no association between KS and water availability for evergreen angiosperms and conifers. These results suggest that the evolution of increased KS may be a critical adaptation to water limitation in deciduous angiosperms. Although there was a significant cross-species correlation between ?50 and KS, this relationship was not supported by the independent contrast correlation, suggesting that the evolutionary basis for a trade-off between cavitation resistance and water transport capacity is weak.},

  abstract = {In recent years the importance of facilitative interactions in ecological communities is increasingly recognized. This phenomenon has been observed repeatedly, particularly in vegetation communities, in a wide range of environmental conditions. The current hypothesis predicts that the role of facilitation becomes increasingly important in conjunction with increasing stress. Several empirical studies, however, failed to detect such patterns, particularly at the extreme ends of the stress gradients. Herein, we present a conceptual model that may resolve discrepancies between expected and observed and provides a more precise framework of the existing hypotheses. By relaxing two common assumptions commonly used by the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) we are able to demonstrate that under some circumstances the importance of facilitation may be less at the extreme ends of these gradients. Namely, we first re-emphasize the notion that physiological response is not linear with respect to environmental changes along stress gradients. Second, it is argued that the net outcome of facilitative and competitive interactions is reflected in the fitness of individuals as a product of these two processes, in contrast to the commonly applied assumption of additivity. Accordingly, a synthesis of the concepts of population biology (measures of fitness) and plant physiology (nonlinear responses) with the stress gradient hypothesis while retaining the original simplicity of the SGH model contributes to a better specification of the predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis and the resolution of observed contradictions.},

  abstract = {Differences between intra- and inter-specific competition strategies in mixed stands account for higher productivity. The mechanisms of competition as they relate to stand structure remain poorly explored. Climatic effects have also been overlooked in most approaches aimed at studying tree growth. These effects were investigated through the case study of beech-oak mixtures in France. A single-tree diameter-increment mixed model was fitted to data gathered from the Laboratoire d'Etude des Ressources Forêt-Bois (LERFoB) network of permanent plots. In order to take stand structure into account, the model was able to distinguish between inter- and intra-specific competition at tree level. Differences in intra- and inter-specific competition are mainly detected in the understorey of oak-dominated stands, where suppressed beech trees performed better than suppressed oak trees. From a climatic point of view, diameter increment was sensitive to the mean temperature of the vegetative period. Concerning competition, our results demonstrate that optimal growth induced by mixtures is not only a matter of species proportion but also depends on stand structure. Regarding climatic effects, they need to be considered in growth predictions, especially given the future climatic conditions predicted for continental Europe. These findings could serve as guidelines for designing strategies to alleviate stress in oak-beech stands.},

  abstract = {Extreme climatic events, such as windstorms and drought, and competition are some of the main factors underlying tree mortality in Atlantic and Central European forest stands. However, current empirical tree mortality models are not adapted to separately consider the different causes of mortality. In addition, these approaches do not distinguish between intra- and inter-specific competition. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical single-tree mortality model that incorporates all of the aforementioned features. On the one hand, extreme events can enter the model via fixed effects and random effects. The latter allows taking the stochasticity of the process into consideration. The distribution of these random effects can be seen as an extreme event severity distribution, which is of great interest for carrying out stochastic simulations on tree mortality. On the other hand, intra- and inter-specific competition is taken into account through linear interactions of species-specific competition indexes and species factors. In order to test this approach, we selected the beech–oak mixture in France as a case study. Beech–oak mixed forests are a common type in France which provides owners with significant economic benefits. Our findings confirm that drought and, especially, windstorm occurrence are major causes of tree mortality in these forests. The model was able to capture the stochasticity of windstorm events by means of random effects. In terms of competition, the probability of mortality in beech understories was expected to decrease in the presence of oak overstories with respect to pure beech stands. This result reveals the importance of complementarity processes in tree mortality.},

  abstract = {Persistent changes in tree mortality rates can alter forest structure, composition, and ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. Our analyses of longitudinal data from unmanaged old forests in the western United States showed that background ( noncatastrophic) mortality rates have increased rapidly in recent decades, with doubling periods ranging from 17 to 29 years among regions. Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees. Regional warming and consequent increases in water deficits are likely contributors to the increases in tree mortality rates.},

Here, we estimated changes in the biomass carbon sink of natural stands throughout Canada's boreal forests using data from long-term forest permanent sampling plots. We found that in recent decades, the rate of biomass change decreased significantly in western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), but there was no significant trend for eastern Canada (Ontario and Quebec). Our results revealed that recent climate change, and especially drought-induced water stress, is the dominant cause of the observed reduction in the biomass carbon sink, suggesting that western Canada's boreal forests may become net carbon sources if the climate change–induced droughts continue to intensify.},

During the late spring of 2001 next cultivating high-type of thinning of 15% intensity in a reduction of stocking density was performed. The PAR regime of investigated stands was continually measured since 1992. Total aboveground biomass (TBa) and TBa increment (DeltaTBa) were obtained on the basis of stand inventory. The dynamic of LAI development showed a tendency to be saturated, i.e. the LAI value close to 11 seems to be maximal for the local conditions of the investigated mountain cultivated Norway spruce stand in the Beskids Mts. Remarkable stimuli (up to 17%) of LAI formation were started in 2002, i.e. as an immediate response to realized thinning. Thus, the positive effect of thinning on LAI increase was confirmed. The data set of absorbed PAR and produced TBa in the period 1998-2003 was processed by the linear regression of Monteith's model, which provided the values of the coefficient of solar energy conversion efficiency into biomass formation (epsilon). The differences in epsilon values between the dense and sparse plot after realized thinning amounted to 18%.},

(3) The results showed that the slope of the trajectory of a stand growing in shade is determined not only by the light climate, but also by its position with respect to the relevant thinning line. This observation excludes one of the three models. We discuss the evidence bearing on the correctness of the other two models.},

The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study.

We addressed whether drought differentially affected the ring-widths of dominant and suppressed trees and if our results supported the hypothesis that, in a Mediterranean climate, suppressed conifer trees suffer greater growth reductions than dominant trees. Climate-growth relationships were analyzed using response and correlation functions, whereas the effect of drought on trees growth was approached by superposed epoch analysis in 10 dry years. A cool, wet autumn and spring, and/or mild winter enhanced radial growth. Latewood was the most sensitive ring section in both kinds of trees and it was primarily influenced by current year precipitations. Earlywood was mostly influenced by climatic conditions previous to the growing season. In general, May was the most influential month. Pinus nigra was shown to be very drought sensitive tree in the study area. Tree-rings in suppressed trees showed lower growth reductions caused by drought than those of dominant trees. However, dominant trees recovered normal growth faster. Dominant trees showed a more plastic response, and suppression appeared to reduce the effect of climate on tree radial growth. Some possible causes for these effects are discussed. Our results support the essential role of the balance between light and moisture limitations for plant development during droughts and show that it is not appropriate to generalize about the way in which suppression affects climate-growth relationship in conifers.},

  abstract = {Thinning is the main forestry measure to increase tree growth by reducing stand tree density and competition for resources. A thinning experiment was established in 1993 on a 32-year-old Pinus nigra Arn. stand in central Spain. The response of growth, climate-growth relationships and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) to a stand density reduction were compared between moderate thinned plots and a control plot by a combined analysis of basal area increments (BAI), and C and O stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C(c) and delta(18)O(c)). BAI in the control plot showed a decreasing trend that was avoided by thinning in the thinned plot. Thinning also partially buffered tree-ring response to climate and trees were less sensitive to precipitation although more sensitive to temperature. Delta(13)C(c) in the thinned plot was not modified indicating that stomatal conductance (g) and photosynthetic capacity (A) did not change or change in the same direction. However, delta(18)O(c) decreased in the control plot (unrelated to delta(18)O of precipitation) but not in the thinned plot, suggesting a relative increase of temperature and irradiance and/or a decrease of air humidity after reducing the density consistent with an increase in A, g and BAI. As WUEi did not increase in the thinned plot, faster growth in this plot was caused by higher abundance of resources per tree. The trend of WUEi in both plots indicated low-moderate CO(2)-induced improvements. Thinning might be a useful adaptation measure against climate change in these plantations reducing their vulnerability to droughts. However, because WUEi was not affected, the positive growth response might be limited if droughts and warming continue and certain thresholds are exceeded. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Positive and negative effects of climate change on forest growth have been observed in different parts of the world. However, much is still unknown about how forest structure and productivity might affect climate-growth relationships in the future. We examined the effects of climate, site quality, and competition on tree basal area growth of black pine (Pinus nigra Am.) between 1964 and 2005 in 21 sites in the Iberian Peninsula. We used a new approach to simultaneously account for climate-growth relationships, inter-annual growth variability, and stand structural changes, by fitting a linear mixed effects model (LMEM) for basal area increments (BAI) using climate data, tree-ring chronologies, and repeated forest inventory data. This approach showed the potential to improve our understanding of climate effects on tree growth and to include climate in empirical forest growth models. We used the LMEM to make projections of BAI growth under two CO(2) emission scenarios and two global circulation models (GCM). The main climate drivers for growth were precipitation from previous autumn to summer and winter temperature with a positive effect, and temperature in spring-summer which had a negative effect. Tree response to climate was modulated by stand conditions, tree competition, and productivity. The more productive stands showed greater ability to either maintain or increase growth at warmer spring-summer temperatures under different levels of autumn-summer precipitation. Growth projections showed important regional differences. In general, growth under future climate is predicted to decrease although moderate growth increases might be expected in the northern region for highly and moderately productive stands.

  abstract = {Estimation of stand growth is crucial for forest planning. Estimations were usually done using fixed values, and recently growth equations have been used. An alternative is through stand growth models. The objective was to develop a simple model for Nothofagus pumilio stands with full density along site quality and age gradients. The sample was obtained from 125 stands with full density, growing at San Justo Ranch, Argentina. Data on forest structure and samples for tree-ring measurement were taken in all trees to estimate growths using biometric models previously developed. The growth values of each plot during the last twenty years were calculated to fit the model, using the ratio of total volume increment/basal area as an independent variable. The developed model gives a ratio between stand volume increment and basal area (m/year) in relation to the site quality and stand age. The statistics ( r2=0.819, mean error=0.019, absolute mean error=0.033), residual analysis and biological performance were satisfactory. The obtained stand growth varied between 1 and 20 m 3/ha/year. This simple model allowed to estimate growth values at a stand level from easy field measurements from forest inventories.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the responses of key tree species to extreme climatic events may provide important information for predicting future forest responses to increased climatic variability. Here we aimed at determining which tree-and stand-level attributes were more closely associated with the effect of a severe drought on the radial growth of Scots pine, both in terms of immediate impact and recovery after the drought event. Our dataset included tree-ring series from 393 plots located close to the dry limit of the species range. Time series analysis and mixed-effects models were used to study the growth of each tree and its detailed response to a severe drought event that occurred in 1986. Our results showed that the radial growth responses of Scots pine were determined primarily by tree-level characteristics, such as age and previous growth rate, and secondarily by stand basal area and species richness, whereas local climate had a relatively minor effect. Fast-growing trees were more severely affected by the drought and retained proportionally lower growth rates up to three years after the episode. In absolute terms, however, fast-growing trees performed better both during and after the event. Older trees were found to be less resilient to drought. The effect of stand basal area and species richness indicated that competition for resources worsened the effects of drought, and suggested that the effect of interspecific competition may be particularly detrimental during the drought year.},

B.S.P.), l'épinette blanche (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.), et le pin rouge (Pinus resinosa Ait.) chacune des espèces plantée selon trois espacements : 1.8m, 2.7m, et 3.6m. Cette étude se penche sur les différences en croissance et en développement de la cime en fonction de l'espacement initial, 37 ans plus tard. De plus, une analyse des bénéfices en fonction des coûts a été effectuée afin d'évaluer l'efficacité économique de différentes combinaisons d'espèces et d'espacement. Le diamètre à hauteur de poitrine, la longueur de la cime vivante et le diamètre de la cime ont tous démontré des augmentations significatives (P < 0.001) en fonction de l'augmentation de l'espacement initial, pour toutes les espèces, mais la hauteur suivait une tendance inverse (P <0.020). Le volume total et le volume marchand par arbre a augmenté pour toutes les espèces à mesure que s'accroissait l'espacement initial, alors que le volume par unité de surface diminuait significativement pour toutes les espèces en fonction de l'augmentation de l'espacement. Le changement vers des produits de plus grande valeur tirés des plantations à espacement plus grand semble procurer le meilleur retour sur l'investissement. Les résultats à la fois au niveau des volumes marchands supérieurs et du plus fort pourcentage de ces volumes disponibles en tant que produit de valeur supérieure ont permis d'obtenir des ratios des bénéfices en fonction des coûts pour le pin rouge (0.995 à 1.337) plus élevés que ceux des épinettes (0.595 à 0.866). Même si le pin rouge ne représente actuellement que moins de 4% de l'effort total de régénération en Ontario, les résultats de cette études démontrent qu'il mérite de plus amples considérations sur certains sites de la forêt boréale.},

  abstract = {When the desired time interval of a difference equation is not the same as the interval at which the data used to fit the equation were collected (the measurement interval), some kind of interpolation method is necessary before fitting. Linear growth assumptions, which are often used for such interpolations, are almost always inconsistent with the growth function that is estimated and can lead to biased growth projections. A more logical approach is to use the hypothesized functional form of the difference equation as the basis for interpolation. Two interpolation methods based on this approach are presented. With one method, both the interpolation and the parameter estimation steps are implemented simultaneously. The second method implements the interpolation and parameter estimation steps separately and requires repeated model fittings until consistency is obtained between both steps. The procedures are demonstrated using a tree height growth example. Results are compared with an integrated, continuous-time version of the growth model that can be fitted without interpolation. Growth projections obtained with the proposed interpolation methods are closer to the projections obtained with the integrated, continuous-time model than projections obtained with other commonly used interpolation methods. A simple Monte Carlo analysis showed that two common interpolation methods based on linear assumptions produce biased parameter estimates but failed to show any bias in the parameter estimates obtained with the proposed methods. Parameter estimates obtained with the new interpolation methods converge to limiting values as the time interval of the difference equation is shortened. These limiting values can be used as estimates of the parameters of continuous-time versions of the growth model.},

  abstract = {Homeostatic maintenance of gas exchange optimizes carbon gain per water loss. Homeostasis is regulated by short-term physiological and long-term structural mechanisms, both of which may respond to changes in resource availability associated with competition. Therefore, stand density regulation via silvicultural manipulations may facilitate growth and survival through mechanisms operating at both short and long timescales. We investigated the responses of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) to stand basal area manipulations in Arizona, USA. Stand basal area was manipulated to seven replicated levels in 1962 and was maintained for four decades by decadal thinning. We measured basal area increment (BAI) to assess the response and sustainability of wood growth, carbon isotope discrimination (A) inferred from annual rings to assess the response of crown gas exchange, and ratios of leaf area to sapwood area (A,:As) to assess longer term structural acclimation. Basal area treatments increased soil water potential (r(2) = 0.99) but did not affect photosynthetic capacity. BAI increased within two years of thinning, and the 40-year mean BAI was negatively correlated with stand basal area (r(2) = 0.98). A was negatively correlated with stand basal area for years 5 through 12 after thinning (r(2) = 0.90). However, A was relatively invariant with basal area for the period 13-40 years after initial thinning despite maintenance of treatment basal areas via repeated decadal thinnings. Independent gas exchange measurements verified that the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance was invariant with basal area, but absolute values of both were elevated at lower basal areas. AI:A, was negatively correlated with basal area (r(2) = 0.93). We hypothesize that increased AI:A, is a homeostatic response to increased water availability that maximizes water-use efficiency and whole-tree carbon uptake. Elevated AI:As of trees at low basal areas was associated with greater resilience to climate, i.e., greater absolute BAI during drought; however, trees with high AI:A, in low basal area stands also exhibited the greatest sensitivity to drought, i.e., greater relative decline in BAI.},

  abstract = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the literature concerning forest and woodland structure at the scale of an individual stand. Stand structure is defined in terms of structural attributes and stand structural complexity. Stand structural complexity is considered to be a measure of the number of different attributes present and the relative abundance of each of these attributes. The review indicates there is no definitive suite of structural attributes; different authors emphasise subsets of different attributes, and relatively few studies provide quantitative evidence linking attributes to the provision of faunal habitat or other measures of biodiversity, although a number of studies identify attributes that distinguish between successional stages. A summary of key structural attributes identified in the literature is presented under the following stand elements: foliage arrangement, canopy cover, tree diameter, tree height, tree spacing, tree species, stand biomass, understorey vegetation, and deadwood. Indices of structural complexity are also reviewed. Three types of index framework are identified: indices based on the cumulative score of attributes; indices based on the average score of groups of attributes; and indices based on the interaction of attributes. The review identifies a variety of different indices under each of these frameworks with no single index preferred over the others. The most prominent of these indices are discussed in detail and the following guidelines suggested for the development of an index of structural complexity: (1) Start with a comprehensive set of structural attributes, in which there is a demonstrated association between attributes and the elements of biodiversity that are of interest. (2) Use a simple mathematical system to construct the index; this facilitates the use of multiple attributes and interpretation of the index in terms of real stand conditions. (3) Score attributes relative to the range of values occurring in stands of a comparable vegetation community. (4) Try different weightings of attributes in the index, adopting those weightings which most clearly distinguish between stands. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This assumption is central to common conservation and management tools such as habitat suitability assessment and species distribution modeling. I test this hypothesis. I use the US Forest Inventory Assessment data for the abundance of trees across eastern North America. I use the FORAST tree-ring dataset for ontogenetic growth rate (tree-ring increment), a measure of niche performance and correlated with intrinsic rate of increase, r. I find that across 15 species, there are significantly more negative correlations than expected by chance. This negative correlation between abundance and performance across space contradicts common assumptions but is consistent with an inclusive niche structuring of the community.},

  abstract = {A potentially confounding radial-growth interaction exists at the intersection of two well-known principles, one in the field of dendrochronology and the other in quantitative genetics. From a dendrochronology perspective, tree populations growing in climatically marginal environments are expected to be more sensitive to seasonal and annual climate than those growing in optimal climate zones. From a genetics perspective, marginal populations may be adapted to grow a small amount each year and then shut down to prevent climate-induced mortality, or they may be adapted to respond to favourable climate conditions when available. We examined the relative strength of these forces using data from 12 populations of 34-year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees growing in 16 provenance-trial sites in western Canada. Growth generally correlated positively with annual temperature and negatively with summer aridity. The sensitivity of radial-growth to interannual climate fluctuations was both site and provenance-related, with the highest sensitivities occurring among populations from warm, central provenances growing at cold, marginal sites, and among populations from cold, marginal provenances growing at warm, central sites. The correlations between climate and growth varied regionally; notably, populations from warm provenances growing at warm sites responded more strongly to summer aridity, while populations from cold provenances growing at warm sites responded more to annual temperature. Our finding that sensitivity varied among populations growing under similar climate conditions indicates that sensitivity is influenced by genetics as well as by site climate, but the regional specificity of the growth responses did not support a single hypothesis for the influence of genetics on growth among populations from marginal vs. central locations. Implications of our study for forest productivity under climate change are more positive for trees growing in cool locations, where overall warmer temperatures will lead to increased growth, than in warm locations, where the negative effects of arid summers may counteract the positive effects of warmer annual temperatures.

  abstract = {Ecologically sustainable forest management aims to maintain biodiversity values within managed forest ecosystems. A key habitat component within Australian forest ecosystems are hollow-bearing trees which are crucially important for fauna species requiring tree hollows for diurnal shelter and nesting. The effect of disturbance regimes, in particular logging and fire, on hollow dynamics is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between logging intensity and fire frequency on hollow abundance and forest stand structural attributes in two different eastern Australian Eucalyptus forest types. We found that average stand tree diameter at breast height was negatively correlated to logging intensity. Logging intensity was negatively correlated with tree diameter at breast height (DBH), and the density of both hollow-bearing trees and hollows. Losses of hollow-bearing trees and hollows occurred through an interaction between logging intensity and fire frequency, resulting in an absence of recruitment of hollow trees. However in unlogged forest, fire was positively correlated to the density of hollows. Under a regime of frequent fire, in areas that have had some degree of logging activity, a net loss of hollows may occur. We recommend additional hollow recruitment trees be retained on logged sites in the future if no net losses of hollows are to occur in the future, or for wider unlogged buffers to be established adjacent to the cutting area.},

The somatic dimensions of several species of animals and of a wide variety of trees fit this rule well.It is a simple matter to show that energy metabolism during maximal sustained work depends on body cross-sectional area, not total body surface area as proposed by Rubner (1) and many after him. This result and the result requiring animal proportions to change with size amount to a derivation of Kleiber's law, a statement only empirical until now, correlating the metabolically related variables with body weight raised to the ¾ power. In the present model, biological frequencies are predicted to go inversely as body weight to the ¼ power, and total body surface areas should correlate with body weight to the ⅝ power. All predictions of the proposed model are tested by comparison with existing data, and the fit is considered satisfactory.In The Fire of Life, Kleiber (5) wrote "When the concepts concerned with the relation of body size and metabolic rate are clarified, . . . then compartive physiology of metabolism will be of great help in solving one of the most intricate and interesting problems in biology, namely the regulation of the rate of cell metabolism." Although Hill (23) realized that "the essential point about a large animal is that its structure should be capable of bearing its own weight and this leaves less play for other factors," he was forced to use an oversimplified "geometric similarity" hypothesis in his important work on animal locomotion and muscular dynamics. It is my hope that the model proposed here promises useful answers in comparisons of living things on both the microscopic and the gross scale, as part of the growing science of form, which asks precisely how organisms are diverse and yet again how they are alike.},

  abstract = {Climate change is highly likely to impact on forest productivity over the next century. The direction and magnitude of change are uncertain because many factors are changing simultaneously, such as atmospheric composition, temperature, rainfall, and land use. Simulation models have been widely used to estimate how these interacting factors might combine to alter forest productivity. Such studies have used many different types of models with different underlying assumptions. To evaluate predictions made by such studies, it is essential to understand the type of model and the assumptions used. In this article, we provide a checklist for use when evaluating modeled estimates of climate change impacts on forest productivity. The checklist highlights the assumptions that we believe are critical in determining model outcomes. Models are classified into different general types, and assumptions relating to effects of atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature, water availability, nutrient cycling, and disturbance are discussed. Our main aim is to provide a guide to enable correct interpretation of model projections. The article also challenges modelers to improve the quality of information provided about their model assumptions.

  abstract = {Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased D as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.},

Compared with the Scots pine trees at the cooler and wetter site in Scotland, the trees at the warmer and drier site in England produced less leaf area per unit of conducting sapwood area both at a stem height of 1.3 m and at the base of the live crown, whereas stem permeability was similar at both sites. Also, trees at the drier site had less leaf area per unit branch cross-sectional area at the branch base than trees at the wetter site. For each site, the average values for leaf area, sapwood area and permeability were used, together with values of transpiration rates at different D, to calculate average stem water potential gradients. Changes in the leaf area/sapwood area ratio acted to maintain a similar water potential gradient in the stems of trees at both sites despite climatic differences between the sites.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in understanding the costs and benefits of increased size and prolonged lifespan for plants. Some species of trees can grow more than 100 m in height and can live for several millennia, however whether these achievements are obtained at the cost of some other physiological functions is currently unclear. As increases in size are usually associated with ageing, it is also unclear whether observed reductions in growth rates and increased mortality rates are a function of size or of age per se. One theory proposes that reduced growth after the start of the reproductive phase is caused by cellular senescence. A second set of theories has focussed instead on plant size and the increased respiratory burdens or excessive height. We report on experimental manipulations to separate the effects of extrinsic factors such as size from those of intrinsic factors such as age for four tree species of contrasting phylogeny and life history. For each species, we measured growth, gas exchange and leaf biochemical properties for trees of different ages and sizes in the field and on propagated material obtained from the same genetic individuals but now all of small similar size in our common gardens. For all species, evidence indicated that size, not cellular senescence, accounted for the observed age-related declines in relative growth rates and net assimilation rates. Two species exhibited evidence of genetic control on leaf characters such as specific leaf area, although size also exerted an independent, and stronger, effect. We found partial support for the theory of hydraulic limitations to tree growth. The lack of a marked separation of soma and germline, an unlimited proliferation potential of meristem cells and the exponential increase in reproductive effort with size all help explain the lack of a senescence-induced decline in trees. It is possible that trees much older than the ones we sampled exhibit senescence symptoms.},

Results showed that accounting for the serial correlation using the spatial power (SP(POW)) or Toeplitz (TOEP(<I>X</I>)) functions resulted in a large reduction in serial correlation and improved the fit of the models. The improved model fits, however, did not unanimously translate into improved model predictions when evaluated under different scenarios. In many cases, the models with the simple independent and identically distributed structure outperformed the models with the SP(POW) or TOEP(<I>X</I>) structure in terms of the models' predictive ability. We also examined the effect of adjusting predictions based on the prediction theorem within the nonlinear mixed modeling framework. It was shown that, in general, the adjusted predictions had lower errors than those without adjustment, but the differences were small in many cases. The adjustment with three prior measurements was better in predictions than the adjustment with only one or two prior measurements for the models with the TOEP(<I>X</I>) structure, but not for SP(POW). A theoretical derivation was developed to prove the insensitivity of the models with the SP(POW) structure to the number of prior measurements.

  abstract = {The hypothesis was tested that upper limits to height growth in trees are the result of the increasing bending moment of trees as they grow in height. The increasing bending moment of tall trees demands increased radial growth at the expense of height growth to maintain mechanical stability. In this study, the bending moment of large lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) was reduced by tethering trees at 10 m height to counter the wind load. Average bending moment of tethered trees was reduced to 38% of control trees. Six years of tethering resulted in a 40% increase in height growth relative to the period before tethering. By contrast, control trees showed decreased height growth in the period after tethering treatment. Average radial growth along the bole, relative to height growth, was reduced in tethered trees. This strongly suggests that mechanical constraints play a crucial role in limiting the height growth of tall trees. Analysis of bending moment and basal area increment at both 10 m and 1.3 m showed that the amount of wood added to the stem was closely related to the bending moment produced at these heights, in both control and tethered trees. The tethering treatment also resulted in an increase in the proportion of latewood at the tethering height, relative to 1.3 m height. For untethered control trees, the ratio of bending stresses at 10 m versus 1.3 m height was close to 1 in both 1998 and 2003, suggesting a uniform stress distribution along the outer surface of the bole.},

  abstract = {Temporal instability of forest climate-growth relationships has been evidenced at high elevations and latitudes, and in Mediterranean contexts. Investigations under temperate conditions, where growth is under the control of both winter frost and summer water stress, are scarce and could provide valuable information about the ability of forest to cope with climate change. To highlight the main climatic factors driving the radial growth of Quercus petraea forests and to detect their possible evolutions over the last century, dendroecological analyses were performed along a longitudinal gradient of both decreasing summer water stress and increasing winter frost in northern France (from oceanic to semi-continental conditions). The climate-growth relationships were evaluated from 31 tree-ring chronologies (720 trees) through the calculation of moving correlation functions. Q. petraea displayed a rather low sensitivity to climate. High temperature in March and water stress from May to July appeared to be the main growth limiting factors. The sensitivity to winter precipitation and summer water stress decreased from oceanic to semi-continental conditions, whilst the correlation to winter frost tended to increase. Moving correlations revealed a general instability of climate-growth relationships, with a moderate synchronicity with climatic fluctuations. The main changes occurred during previous autumn for both temperature and precipitation whilst climatic trends were rather low or non-significant. The most coherent trends were pointed out (i) in April with a cooling (-0.9A degrees C) leading to positive correlation to temperature at the end of the century, and (ii) in July with a decreasing inter-annual variability of precipitation resulting in a loss of correlation. On the contrary, the decreasing temperature and increasing precipitation in May and June led to few significant changes climate-growth relationships.},

  abstract = {Existing literature investigates the effect of the number of cored trees per plot (N) on chronology statistics. The present study sought to highlight (i) the effect of N on the reliability of both chronology and climate growth relationships and (ii) its variability across five European tree species with differentiated ecophysiological patterns. Fifty-eight pure, even-aged forests were sampled across France. For each plot, dendroecological investigations were carried out using chronologies built from 28 to three trees. Chronology reliability was studied using the mean intertree correlation (rbt) and the expressed population signal (EPS), whereas the climate growth relationships were evaluated through the bootstrapped correlation coefficients (BCC). The accuracy of the dendroecological investigations decreased with decreasing N: EPS and BCC approached zero, implying that the signal common to all trees weakened. Thus, most of the significant correlations became nonsignificant when the sample size decreased from 28 to three trees per plot. Differences were found between species. For a given sample size, the shade-intolerant species Quercus petraea and Pinus sylvestris displayed lower intertree differences in growth-index series (higher rbt) and higher EPS than the shade-tolerant species Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, and Picea abies. These latter species also displayed a greater sensitivity to sample size decrease, with a stronger BCC weakening and a higher proportion of changes in correlation significance. The EPS threshold of 0.85 was reached for around six to 10 trees for shade-intolerant species versus 20-30 for the shade-tolerant ones and generally corresponded to a mean correlation precision of around 0.06. We finally propose a general method to estimate this precision.},

  abstract = {In most dendrochronological studies, climate-growth relationships are established on dominant trees to minimize non-climatic signals. However, response to environmental factors may be affected by tree-size, which begs the question of the representativeness of dominant trees on the stand level. To highlight the variations in climate-growth relationships among sizes and species, under a wide range of ecological conditions (climate and soil properties), 61 pure even-aged stands were sampled across France. At each stand, two tree-ring chronologies were established from 10 big- to 10 small-diameter trees. Our objectives were, (1) to assess variations in climate sensitivity between the two size-diameter classes, and (2) to investigate the role of species and ecological conditions on these variations. The climate-growth relationships were evaluated from 122 tree-ring chronologies (1 220 trees) through extreme growth years and correlation function analyses. Sensitivity to climate of shade-intolerant and moderately shade-tolerant species (Picea abies (L) Karst., Pinus sylvestris L and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) remained constant between the size-diameter classes for both temperature and hydric balance, while the shade-tolerant species Abies alba Mill. and Fagus sylvatica L displayed significant differences, with larger trees being more sensitive to summer drought than smaller trees. This difference increased with increasing climatic xericity. our results suggest that, for shade-tolerant species, (1) big trees could be more sensitive to climatic change especially under xeric climate, and (2) future tree ring studies should include trees stratified by size to produce unbiased estimation of sensitivity to climate.

  abstract = {Abstract The IPCC previsions for the upcoming decades include an increase in frequency and intensity of drought events in several regions worldwide, including Northern Europe. Drought significantly affects forest ecosystems through decreased productivity, increased vulnerability to biotic disturbances and increased subsequent mortality. How forest ecosystems maintain resistance and resilience to drought events are important questions. Our study aimed to assess whether species mixture or an individual tree size within a stand alters a given tree’s resilience and resistance to drought. A retrospective study of tree-ring widths allowed us to calculate resistance, resilience and recovery indices for five recent drought events: 1976, the 1990–1992 period, 2003, 2006 and 2010. These drought events were selected based on the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) drought index. Our study sample consisted of 108 individual sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.)) or Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees sampled in 2012 and 2013 (Orleans forest, central France) in pure and mixed stands, divided into three diameter classes corresponding to three sizes: large, medium and small trees. Scots pine performed better than sessile oak during the 1990–1992 and 2010 droughts while the contrary was observed for the 2003 and 2006 droughts. They performed equally in 1976. We suggest that the differing sensitivity of the two species to spring and summer drought explained this result. In our study, stand composition had no effect on resilience or resistance for either species. The size effect in oaks was unclear as small oaks displayed either a better performance or a worse performance than large oaks. Small pines displayed better resistance and resilience than pines of a larger size. This work stressed the importance of taking into account stand composition and trees size as well as soil and climatic conditions for each drought events to achieve a better understanding of the diversity of responses to climatic variations among forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Changes in size inequality in tree populations are often attributed to changes in the mode of competition over time. The mode of competition may also fluctuate annually in response to variation in growing conditions. Factors causing growth rate to vary can also influence competition processes, and thus influence how size hierarchies develop. Methods Detailed data obtained by tree-ring reconstruction were used to study annual changes in size and size increment inequality in several even-aged, fire-origin jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands in the boreal shield and boreal plains ecozones in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada, by using the Gini and Lorenz asymmetry coefficients. Key Resutls The inequality of size was related to variables reflecting long-term stand dynamics (e.g. stand density, mean tree size and average competition, as quantified using a distance-weighted absolute size index). The inequality of size increment was greater and more variable than the inequality of size. Inequality of size increment was significantly related to annual growth rate at the stand level, and was higher when growth rate was low. Inequality of size increment was usually due primarily to large numbers of trees with low growth rates, except during years with low growth rate when it was often due to small numbers of trees with high growth rates. The amount of competition to which individual trees were subject was not strongly related to the inequality of size increment. Conclusions Differences in growth rate among trees during years of poor growth may form the basis for development of size hierarchies on which asymmetric competition can act. A complete understanding of the dynamics of these forests requires further evaluation of the way in which factors that influence variation in annual growth rate also affect the mode of competition and the development of size hierarchies.},

  abstract = {Permanent sample plots (PSPs), measured at 5- to 10-year intervals, are presently used to monitor stand development in boreal forests in Canada. These data cannot easily be used to study inter-annual variability in stand development processes nor can they monitor the effects of transient factors affecting stands annually because of their coarse temporal resolution. It also takes a considerable period of time to obtain time series of data for regions without PSPs. Long re-measurement intervals are necessary because instruments like diameter tapes, calipers and clinometers cannot discern annual growth in these slow-growing forests. Dendrochronological stand reconstruction techniques are a method that can be used to obtain annual data on forest growth and stand development. We show that these techniques can provide annual information on stand development patterns while periodic measurements of PSPs cannot, and that these data can be obtained in a short period of time, relative to waiting to obtain data from PSPs established today. Detailed, annual data will become more important in the future, as climate change will affect both forest growth and stand dynamics. Annual resolution data on these processes will be required to describe and account for these effects.},

  abstract = {A large body of literature suggests that asymmetric competition, where large individuals suppress the growth of smaller individuals by intercepting a disproportionate share of incoming light, is a dominant process in tree population development. This has not been examined extensively for long-lived tree species that accumulate growth over many years under varying growing conditions. Using dendrochronological techniques, we reconstructed annual growth and mortality rates at ten stands of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) in Western Canada. We used these data to calculate an annual index of the size asymmetry of growth for each stand for the last 50 years. Jack pine is a shade-intolerant species found in even-aged monoculture stands, so the simple hypothesis is that large trees should consistently perform relatively better than small trees. Inter-annual variation in the index of size-asymmetric growth was positively associated with interannual variation in stand productivity at eight of ten sites. The size asymmetry of growth also showed a positive trend with age at eight of ten sites, even though all sites were in a period of declining leaf area. This should have reduced the intensity of asymmetric competition for light and reduced the size asymmetry of growth over time. Alternate hypotheses for this trend are (1) that physical collisions between crowns result in asymmetric competition for growing space because they are more damaging to small trees, or (2) that a differential build up of diseases in susceptible trees suppresses their growth, even in the absence of competition.},

  abstract = {Some forest-related studies on possible effects of climate change conclude that growth potential of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) might be impaired by the predicted increase in future serious drought events during the growing season. Other recent research suggests that not only multiyear increment rates but also growth resistance and recovery of beech during, respectively, after dry years may differ between pure and mixed stands. Thus, we combined dendrochronological investigations and wood stable isotope measurements to further investigate the impact of neighborhood diversity on long-term performance, short-term drought response and soil water availability of European beech in three major geographic regions of Germany. During the last four decades, target trees whose competitive neighborhood consisted of co-occurring species exhibited a superior growth performance compared to beeches in pure stands of the same investigation area. This general pattern was also found in exceptional dry years. Although the summer droughts of 1976 and 2003 predominantly caused stronger relative growth declines if target trees were exposed to interspecific competition, with few exceptions they still formed wider annual rings than beeches growing in close-by monocultures. Within the same study region, recovery of standardized beech target tree radial growth was consistently slower in monospecific stands than in the neighborhood of other competitor species. These findings suggest an improved water availability of beech in mixtures what is in line with the results of the stable isotope analysis. Apparently, the magnitude of competitive complementarity determines the growth response of target beech trees in mixtures. Our investigation strongly suggest that the sensitivity of European beech to environmental constrains depends on neighborhood identity. Therefore, the systematic formation of mixed stands tends to be an appropriate silvicultural measure to mitigate the effects of global warming and droughts on growth patterns of Fagus sylvatica.},

  abstract = {In most dendroclimatological reconstructions, cores are usually taken from the biggest and oldest trees in a stand. The objective of the present study was to investigate the possible influence of such a subjective sampling technique in climate reconstructions using tree ring data. In order to assess the implications of any influence, the study was carried out in two stands with different site elevations and different climate data was used for one of the sites. Twenty-seven spruce trees from an upper timberline site and 18 spruce trees from a lower montane site were investigated. On both sites, subsets of nine doininant and nine suppressed trees were established on the basis of social status and stem diameter. Four additional subsets were made up of trees from the timberline site. The subsets ''winner", "loser" and "indifferent" were based on cumulative basal increment growth, and the subset "damaged" only; contained trees with strong stem wood injuries. The climate response of each subset was calculated using bootstrap response functions over the investigation period 1901-1995. Mean monthly temperature and monthly precipitation sums were used as independent variables. For the subalpine site, response function models with measured and modelled climate data were calculated. On the subalpine site, the results indicate significant positive correlation of tree-ring growth to monthly mean temperatures in lune (r = 0.294) and July (r = 0.305), and on the lower montane site, significant negative correlation to June temperatures (r = -0.234). Shifts in the correlation values of single months between the subsets as well as between the models with measured and modelled climate data series were small. The largest difference in the tree-ring growth - climate relationship was found between the subalpine: and lower montane sites. The results reveal that the common sampling strategy in dendroclimotology (oldest, largest and dominant trees) hardly affects the results in annual climate response. The results also confirm that ecological site conditions are the most determining factors in the growth models. The selection of meteorological stations can also affect the results but this is of secondary importance. The social status of the toe is of less importance for tree ring growth compared to site elevation and the weather stations used for the regression model. Thus, restricting sampling to the biggest and oldest trees does not seem to be a major problem for dendroclimatological reconstructions.},

  abstract = {In addition to global warming, the frequency and the intensity of droughts will probably increase in central and southern Europe. Resulting climate changes and soil water deficits could alter tree growth, according to sensitivity of each species. The aim of this study was to compare the growth response of three European species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Pinus sylvestris) to climatic variations and soil water deficits in the same temperate forest. Three mature stands per species were sampled to obtain earlywood, latewood and total ring chronologies from 1960 to 2007. Climate-growth relationships were established by bootstrapped correlations and response function analysis. Monthly bioclimatic regressors were simulated by a physiological water balance model that used daily climatic data and stand parameters to estimate soil water deficits. Our results highlighted a common sensitivity to precipitation from May to July for the dominant tree growth of the three species but also differences in the species vulnerability to climate and soil water deficits. Beech was the most sensitive species to the climatic conditions of the current growing season. Beech growth was positively correlated with precipitation from May to July and negatively with maximal temperatures in June and July. Oak growth was negatively correlated with minimal temperatures in the previous August and September and positively with precipitation in the previous October and December during pointer years. This led to long-term consequences for growth, probably due to carbon reserve depletion. Pine growth was positively influenced by warm December but was also vulnerable to maximal temperatures and soil water deficits from June to August. The climate in August only influenced the pine growth probably because the growing season of pine was longer than that of the deciduous species. For both oak and pine, latewood was the component that was most sensitive to climatic variations and soil water deficits. According to the study findings, an increase in the frequency and the intensity of droughts could affect the three species. Maximum summer temperatures could have negative impacts for beech and pine growth. Dry and warm autumns could lead to long-term consequences and decrease the oak growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We developed habitat suitability models at multiple spatial scales for a threatened freshwater turtle, Emydoidea blandingii, in Ontario as a case study. We also explored the effect of background data selection and modelling algorithm selection on habitat suitability predictions. We used sighting records, high-resolution land cover data (25 m), and two SDM techniques: boosted regression trees; and maximum entropy modelling. The area under the receiver characteristic operating curve (AUC) for habitat suitability models tested on independent data ranged from 0.878 to 0.912 when using random background and from 0.727 to 0.741 with target-group background. E. blandingii habitat suitability was best predicted by air temperature, wetland area, open water area, road density, and cropland area. Habitat suitability increased with increasing air temperature and wetland area, and decreased with increasing cropland area. Low road density and open water increased habitat suitability, while high levels of either variable decreased habitat suitability. Robust habitat suitability maps for species at risk require using a multi-scale and multi-algorithm approach. If well used, SDM can offer insight on the habitat requirements of species at risk and help guide the development of management plans. Our results suggest that E. blandingii management plans should promote the protection of terrestrial habitat surrounding residential wetlands, halt the building of roads within and adjacent to currently occupied habitat, and identify movement corridors for isolated populations.},

We encourage flexible approaches that promote reversible and incremental steps, and that favor ongoing learning and capacity to modify direction as situations change. We suggest that no single solution fits all future challenges, especially in the context of changing climates, and that the best strategy is to mix different approaches for different situations. Resources managers will be challenged to integrate adaptation strategies ( actions that help ecosystems accommodate changes adaptively) and mitigation strategies ( actions that enable ecosystems to reduce anthropogenic influences on global climate) into overall plans. Adaptive strategies include resistance options ( forestall impacts and protect highly valued resources), resilience options ( improve the capacity of ecosystems to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response options ( facilitate transition of ecosystems from current to new conditions). Mitigation strategies include options to sequester carbon and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. Priority-setting approaches ( e. g., triage), appropriate for rapidly changing conditions and for situations where needs are greater than available capacity to respond, will become increasingly important in the future.},

Lateral extension of the fungus was more rapid in the roots of suppressed trees than in the roots of dominant ones during periods ranging from 5 to 8 weeks. In laboratory tests, the growth of F. annosus in root segments removed from dominant and suppressed trees was as great or greater after 14 days than in the inoculated living roots after 35 to 56 days. Growth rate of F. annosus in detached root segments from dominant trees was essentially similar to that in detached root segments of suppressed trees. The average percent reserve carbohydrates in lateral roots of dominant trees was generally higher than in roots of suppressed ones. Diameter growth for the past 5 years, significantly greater in dominant than in suppressed trees, was directly correlated with root reserve carbohydrates. Mycelial growth of F. annosus in inoculated living roots and in root segments was inversely related to root reserve carbohydrates. The percent reserve carbohydrates in different roots of indiviual loblolly pines in dense stands varied considerably, but little variation was found in different roots of isolated pines. No difference was found between nitrogen content of roots from dominant and suppressed trees; however, the average carbohydrate/nitrogen ratio was significantly higher in the roots of dominant than in roots of suppressed trees.},

  abstract = {A thinning experiment has been conducted since 1971 on two 22-year-old stands of Norway spruce in the Belgian Ardenne. The stands have strongly contrasting water availability. In 1995, tree ring-width series were measured from increment cores sampled in control plots along with three different thinning intensity treatments. Relative growth indices were calculated by standardisation which involved fitting a curve to the measured series, and then dividing each measured value by the corresponding curve value. Based on reconstruction of the monthly values of soil water content (SWC), climatic response functions were calibrated on growth indices from the control treatment. In the humid stand, radial growth is mostly under lagged climatic control. In the dry stand, radial growth is instantaneously related to water supply during the early part of the vegetation period. The response functions were used to remove the climatic signal present in the growth indices calculated for the thinned treatments. This procedure does not allow the entire climatic signal in the growth indices of the dry stand to be removed. We show that reducing the stand density alters the classical relationship between climate and radial growth. At least in the short term, thinning improves the resistance of tree radial growth to drought stresses. This effect is more obvious on the humid stand than on the dry stand. We show also that observations and climate-based simulation of growth indices in the heavily thinned treatments have an inverse cycling behaviour. In the humid stand, trees from the heavily thinned plots showed growth reduction during the eighties, while simulation growth indices from the climatic response function were quite stable. While tree growth from the lightly thinned treatment remains coupled to climate because of high inter-tree competition for water supply, tree growth from the heavily thinned plots could be sensitive to other limiting factors that may involve atmospheric pollution.

Liebl.) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.)) growing in contrasting climates (temperate and Mediterranean). Growth data were obtained using dendroecological sampling procedures. Results obtained with both methods are consistent, but the MAIDEN model provides a more explanatory analysis than classical statistical tools. Analyses with MAIDEN indicate that oak stomatal conductance is sensitive to atmospheric vapor deficit, whereas precipitation and soil water deficit are not limiting factors in the study area. In contrast, the soil water regime is the major controlling factor of bole growth variability for Aleppo pine. The model shows that remobilization of the carbohydrate reserves in spring is of major importance for leaf and root expansion, and it affects the subsequent bole increment of oak. Because the amount of carbon that can be mobilized in spring is linked to carbon stored the previous year, these processes explain how the growth of oak trees is linked in this way from one year to the next. In contrast, the MAIDEN model shows that carbohydrate-reserve dynamics, phenology, and bole growth are less connected for Aleppo pine trees.},

This paper provides an integrative overview of the nature, contributing factors and impacts of wind-caused disturbance in forests, including its effects on trees, stands, landscapes and soils. Windthrow is examined through the integrating concepts of: the capacity of trees for acclimative growth, the limitation of acclimative growth under inter-tree competition, the recurrent nature of severe weather, how terrain and soil conditions affect local stand vulnerability and the effect of recurrent windthrow on stand dynamics and soils. Windthrow management should take place within a framework of general risk management, with evaluation of the likelihood, severity and potential impacts of wind damage considered – with reference to the broad and specific aims of management. There is much to be gained from interdisciplinary communication about the nature and consequences of recurrent wind damage. There are opportunities for climatologists, engineers, ecologists, geomorphologists and others to develop integrative process models at the tree, stand and landscape scales that will improve our collective understanding, and inform management decision-making.},

Typically, variants of classification and regression trees implemented in Rulequest's© See5 and Cubist (for binary and continuous responses, respectively) are the tools of choice in many of these applications. These tools are widely used in large remote sensing applications, but are not easily interpretable, do not have ties with survey estimation methods, and use proprietary unpublished algorithms. Consequently, three alternative modelling techniques were compared for mapping presence and basal area of 13 species located in the mountain ranges of Utah, USA. The modelling techniques compared included the widely used See5/Cubist, generalized additive models (GAMs), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB). Model performance was evaluated using independent test data sets. Evaluation criteria for mapping species presence included specificity, sensitivity, Kappa, and area under the curve (AUC). Evaluation criteria for the continuous basal area variables included correlation and relative mean squared error. For predicting species presence (setting thresholds to maximize Kappa), SGB had higher values for the majority of the species for specificity and Kappa, while GAMs had higher values for the majority of the species for sensitivity. In evaluating resultant AUC values, GAM and/or SGB models had significantly better results than the See5 models where significant differences could be detected between models. For nine out of 13 species, basal area prediction results for all modelling techniques were poor (correlations less than 0.5 and relative mean squared errors greater than 0.8), but SGB provided the most stable predictions in these instances. SGB and Cubist performed equally well for modelling basal area for three species with moderate prediction success, while all three modelling tools produced comparably good predictions (correlation of 0.68 and relative mean squared error of 0.56) for one species.},

Climatic data were obtained from the Alberta Climate Model, which is based on 30-year normals from the provincial weather station network. Mapping methods were based on ANUSPLIN, Hutchinson's thin-plate smoothing spline in four dimensions (latitude, longitude, elevation, climatic variable). Site indices based on stem analysis (observed dominant height at an index age of 50 years at breast height) were used as a measure of forest site productivity. A total of 1145 site index plots were available for lodgepole pine, the major forest species in Alberta. Regression analyses were used to predict site index as a function of climatic variables for each plot. The strongest linear predictors of site index were growing degree days > 5 degrees (GDD5), the Julian date when GDD5 reaches 100 (D100), and July mean temperature (MTWM). A nonlinear model with D100 as the predictor variable was chosen as the final model. Both the observed and the predicted site indices from the 1145 locations were interpolated using ANUSPLIN and mapped using ArcView. We concluded that climate is an important component of site productivity, accounting for about one quarter of the variation in lodgepole pine site index across the province.},

Considerable warming is apparent in all three models. On average, the increases in mean GDD(5) (growing degree-daysa > 5C) are 18%, 38%, and 65% by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively. Change in precipitation is essentially nil. This results in proportional increases in dryness index. We used the dryness index to predict the potential future range and GDD(5) to predict its potential productivity. Generally, lodgepole pine site index is predicted to increase steadily by 3m for each 30-year period. Offsetting this increase is a large reduction in suitable area as drying increases. At first, the warming increases the potential range up to 67% by the 2020s but then shrinks from 34% to 58% of its current area by 2080. Such major changes will need to be considered when setting long-term forest management plans. The increased risk of both wildfire and insect outbreaks further compounds this planning problem, especially because these disturbance events can interact and further increase risk.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of crop production is defined in thermodynamic terms as the ratio of energy output (carbohydrate) to energy input (solar radiation). Temperature and water supply are the main climatic constraints on efficiency. Over most of Britain, the radiation and thermal climates are uniform and rainfall is the main discriminant of yield between regions. Total production of dry matter by barley, potatoes, sugar beet, and apples is strongly correlated with intercepted radiation and these crops form carbohydrate at about 1.4 g per MJ solar energy, equivalent to 2.4% efficiency. Crop growth in Britain may therefore be analysed in terms of (a) the amount of light intercepted during the growing season and (b) the efficiency with which intercepted light is used. The amount intercepted depends on the seasonal distribution of leaf area which, in turn, depends on temperature and soil water supply. These variables are discussed in terms of the rate and duration of development phases. A factorial analysis of efficiency shows that the major arable crops in Britain intercept only about 40% of annual solar radiation and their efficiency for supplying energy through economic yield is only about 0.3%. Some of the factors responsible for this figure are well understood and some are immutable. More work is needed to identify the factors responsible for the large differences between average commercial and record yields.},

  abstract = {To select suitable planting stock for reforestation under uncertain future climates, information about tolerances of genotypes to different climate conditions is necessary. One useful approach is to combine dendrochronological research with common garden experiments to quantify genotype by environment interactions observed over time. Here, we assess the response of Douglas-fir provenances planted in a common environment to climate variation over five decades using tree-ring analysis and historic height data. A rare drought event that affected growth in the year of 1985 provided the opportunity to study how mature Douglas-fir provenances differ in resilience and resistance to drought conditions and whether there are trade-offs with long-term productivity. We found that overall growth performance of provenances originating from drier and colder environments within the coastal range was below average and correlated with interannual variation in temperature. Productive provenances originated primarily from moist and warm areas and their annual increments co-varied strongly with summer precipitation and summer drought indices. Further, provenances with below average growth were able to recover more quickly from the drought event of 1985, but did not show stronger drought resistance than coastal sources. Our results provide evidence for trade-offs between productivity and drought resilience and show that sources originating from moist locations are more dependent on favorable growing conditions in the summer. We conclude that selecting drought-resilient planting stock as an adaptation strategy for climate change is possible, but it would entail reductions in productivity.},

  abstract = {An individual distance-independent girth increment model for pure stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (MIRB.) FRANCO), comprising two equations, is presented. The data used to fit the model were collected from 1007 trees in 42 plots installed in regularly stocked and even-aged stands located in Wallonia (southern Belgium). Both equations predict girth increment from individual girth, dominant height, basal area per hectare, stand mean girth and variables linked to site fertility. These last variables are the site index H50 in the first equation, and a combination of mean annual rainfall and altitude in the second. The coefficient of determination ranges from 0.434 to 0.481 and the root mean square error ranges from 0.7857 to 0.8194 cm year(-1). Estimated increments of 224 Douglas-fir trees in 12 different and independent stands were used to validate the model, which is expected to provide reliable predictions for most of the pure Douglas-fir stands located in the study area.

  abstract = {The effect of variations in fertility level of the substrate on the self-thinning lines followed by populations of Ocimum basilicum L. was investigated experimentally by establishing populations over a range of densities at two fertility levels. Populations from each fertility level followed different self-thinning lines for shoot biomass. Self-thinning began at a lower biomass in populations grown at the higher fertility level; the subsequent slope of the thinning line was −0.5 for these stands on a log shoot biomass versus log density plot. The slope of the self-thinning line was flatter (−0.29) at the lower fertility level. Fitting the self-thinning line by the Structural Relationship rather than the Major Axis made little difference to line estimates. Biomass packing differed with fertility level, with plants from the higher fertility stands requiring more canopy volume for given shoot biomass than plants from lower fertility levels. Biologically, this would mean shoot competition intensified more rapidly at the higher fertility level as biomass accumulated in stands. The difference in slope between fertility levels was associated with changes above- and belowground. The radial extension of the canopy versus shoot mass relationships of individual plants differed with fertility level. Plants at the lower fertility level allocated more biomass to root growth, and had less leaf area per unit root length. The differences in slope of the self-thinning lines may have been because of differences in the radial extension of the canopy versus shoot mass relationships of individual plants at each fertility level, and/or to an increase in root competition at the lower fertility level.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of tree diversity and forest structure is a key pre-requisite for understanding and managing forest ecosystems. This paper addresses the question whether and how tree diversity measures can be estimated as extensions of existing forest resource inventories. The sampling simulator CRANCOD was employed to compare the precision of angle count and fixed radius plot sampling with respect to nine representative diversity indices. The sampling methods were compared (a) in their overall precision in terms of estimating diversity indices and (b) in their ability to provide precise estimations for three different forest types independent of the spatial inventory scale, e.g. inventories at stand or enterprises level or national forest inventories. The results indicated that most of the spatially explicit indices are more precisely estimated by fixed radius plots. Interestingly the superiority of fixed radius plot sampling to angle count sampling increases significantly with increasing diameter differentiation of forests. However, basal area, basal area related diversity indices and Pielou's segregation index can be estimated by angle count sampling with at least the same precision as from fixed radius plots. This provides options for situations where discarding angle count sampling is not possible because permanent sampling designs are in place or the importance of forestry summary statistics exceeds that of tree diversity by far.

  journal =  {Annals of Botany},
  year =     {2011},
  abstract = {Background and Aims Although being tall is advantageous in light competition, plant height growth is often similar among dominant plants in crowded stands (height convergence). Previous theoretical studies have suggested that plants should not overtop neighbours because greater allocation to supporting tissues is necessary in taller plants, which in turn lowers leaf mass fraction and thus carbon gain. However, this model assumes that a competitor has the same potential of height growth as their neighbours, which does not necessarily account for the fact that height convergence occurs even among individuals with various biomass.Methods Stands of individually potted plants of Chenopodium album were established, where target plants were lifted to overtop neighbours or lowered to be overtopped. Lifted plants were expected to keep overtopping because they intercept more light without increased allocation to stems, or to regulate their height to similar levels of neighbours, saving biomass allocation to the supporting organ. Lowered plants were expected to be suppressed due to the low light availability or to increase height growth so as to have similar height to the neighbours.Key Results Lifted plants reduced height growth in spite of the fact that they received higher irradiance than others. Lowered plants, on the other hand, increased the rate of stem elongation despite the reduced irradiance. Consequently, lifted and lowered plants converged to the same height. In contrast to the expectation, lifted plants did not increase allocation to leaf mass despite the decreased stem length. Rather, they allocated more biomass to roots, which might contribute to improvement of mechanical stability or water status. It is suggested that decreased leaf mass fraction is not the sole cost of overtopping neighbours. Wind blowing, which may enhance transpiration and drag force, might constrain growth of overtopping plants.Conclusions The results show that plants in crowded stands regulate their height growth to maintain similar height to neighbours even when they have potential advantages in height growth. This might contribute to avoidance of stresses caused by wind blowing.},

  abstract = {Growth modelling of complex stands calls for the use of spatially explicit single-tree models. Such models require spatially explicit tree locations as the initial state to run simulations. Given the cost of such data, virtual forest stands, where tree locations are simulated, are generally used as the initial state. The purpose of this study was to present models for simulating the spatial structure of complex stands. It focused on mixed oak-Scots pine stands of the Orleans forest (France) and on the spatial structure of canopy trees. The spatial structure of the oak-pine stands was modelled with appropriate point process models. The models consisted of a combination of Poisson, Neyman-Scott and Soft core. Simulation of the point process models was based on precise characterisation of the studied stands. Twenty-five 1-ha oak-pine plots were characterised by the Ripley function. The models were then fitted to the identified spatial structure to reproduce univariate and bivariate spatial patterns in each spatial type. This paper provides an approach for general modelling of a spatial structure of a particular mixture and may be enriched by other point process models for other types of mixed stand.},

  abstract = {Spatial pattern has a key role in the interactions between species in plant communities. These interactions influence ecological processes involved in the species dynamics: growth, regeneration and mortality. In this study, we investigated the effect of spatial pattern on productivity in mature mixed forests of sessile oak and Scots pine. We simulated tree locations with point process models and tree growth with spatially explicit individual growth models. The point process models and growth models were fitted with field data from the same stands. We compared species productivity obtained in two types of mixture: a patchy mixture and an intimate mixture. Our results show that the productivity of both species is higher in an intimate mixture than in a patchy mixture. Productivity difference between the two types of mixture was 11.3 % for pine and 14.7 % for oak. Both species were favored in the intimate mixture because, for both, intraspecific competition was more severe than interspecific competition. Our results clearly support favoring intimate mixtures in mature oak-pine stands to optimize tree species productivity; oak is the species that benefits the most from this type of management. Our work also shows that models and simulations can provide interesting results for complex forests with mixtures, results that would be difficult to obtain through experimentation.},

However, in some trees, the trend is substantially different from the regional curve, and when the site fertility is not taken into account the standardisation process may induce significant biases in the RCS standardised curve An artificial neural network is used here to estimate an adaptive regional growth curve (ARGC) model. For each population or group Of Populations, the predictors are, in addition to the age (used by RCS) of each ring, the initial and the maximum growth rates (measured by the ring increments) of each tree. We have compared this method to the RCS method, Using 20 Pinus cembra sites covering the Southern French Alps.

In this paper we show that the production functions of Liebig, Mitscherlich and Liebscher for the relation between nutrient supply and crop production can be regarded as special variants of one 'integrated model'. The model is elaborated for two nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, and is based on the Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic equation. This basic equation has two main terms and one multiplicative interaction term. The parameter values determine which one of the aforementioned functions is generated. 'Greenwood's variant of the Michaelis-Menten function' is approached if the main terms dominate. 'De Wit's variant of the Mitscherlich function' is approached if the multiplicative term dominates. Liebig's function emerges from any of these variants if nutrient supply is constrained to such an extent that nutrient uptake continually exhausts the nutrient stock. The 'Liebscher variant' - considered the most appropriate for most empirical situations - is intermediate between those of Liebig, Michaelis-Menten and 'De Wit's Mitscherlich', and can be obtained by parameter calibration. Generally, these functions result in 'decreasing marginal returns' with increasing nutrient supply. However, ifinteracting nutrients are supplied in precisely the required proportion, the variant with a multiplicative term does show 'increasing marginal returns', but only in conditions of low nutrient supply rates, low nutrient affinities and/or high nutrient losses.},

A review of the available information on scaling relationships observed for large tree-sized plants, nevertheless, indicates that mechanical and hydraulic requirements impose dual restraints on plant height and thus, may play equally (but differentially) important roles during the growth of arborescent, large-sized species. It may be the case that adaptations to mechanical and hydraulic phenomena have optimized growth, survival and reproductive success rather than longevity and mature size.},

This derivation provides indirect verification of the allometric theory.

In this review paper, we found that extreme climatic events, such as heat waves, frost, drought and flooding, usually reduces plant production and induces mortality. The magnitude of impacts on production and mortality are exceedingly variable, which likely result from different severities of the climate extremes, sensitivities of various processes, vegetation types, and inherent regulatory mechanisms of plants and ecosystems. Climatologically severe events may not necessarily trigger plant responses. Different processes respond to the same extreme events differently. Such different responses also vary with species. Moreover, plants likely activate a variety of physiological and molecular mechanisms regulate their responses to extremes. Documenting those variable responses and identifying their causes are critical to advancing our understanding. Nevertheless, our research has to move beyond the documentation of phenomenon to reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying plant responses to climate extremes. Toward that goal, we need to define extreme climatic events under a plant perspective and evaluate different response patterns of various processes to climate extremes. In this review, we also propose to focus our future research on manipulative field experiments and coordinated networks of experiments at multiple sites over different regions to understand the real-world responses of plants and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Fitting annual tree growth and survival models to data with irregular measurement intervals requires special consideration to the interpolation of the independent variables. This study presents an iterative method for continuously updating individual-tree and stand attributes, using the hypothesized functional form of a system of forward difference equations. Based on data from permanent sample plots, parameter estimates were obtained for three first-order difference equations of diameter and height growth and mortality for European beech in Denmark. One parameter of the individual-tree diameter and height growth models was estimated locally and expresses apparent site quality. The plot-specific parameters of the individual-tree growth models were highly correlated with site index and plot-specific estimates of rate constants from a dominant height growth model. Parameter estimates of individual-tree models based on either of those indicators of site quality allow for a flexible use of the models. The study failed to establish any relation between plot-specific rate constants and soil texture variables. The resulting system of individual-tree models is consistent with tree growth and mortality expected for beech in Denmark.},

The effect of competition oil growth was modelled by coupling the n individual equations simultaneously with it saturation term. By assuming that the growth of an individual within the population is a function of its size to a power a, a measure of the growth advantage of larger individuals (size-asymmetric growth) is provided. If a > 1, larger trees have a disproportionate advantage in growth and by inference, in competition. The degree of size-asymmetric growth, a. exceeded one in stands with large size variability and increased significantly at increasing density. This suggests that the predominant mode of competition is size asymmetric and that this size asymmetry increases with density. A measure of growth asymmetry is more informative than static measures of size inequality in understanding the growth dynamics of managed forest stands. Since a provides a measure of the relative importance of above- versus below-ground competition, it may be useful in interpreting the growth dynamics of forest stands and may provide all additional level of information for modellers of forest growth.},

Diameter growth of dominant individuals (with the largest diameter at the age before the first thinning) was measured in all variants of experimental series (control and thinned). Monthly average temperature and total precipitation were taken from the nearest climatological stations and, additionally, three climatic factors (precipitation and temperature ratio in different periods) were calculated. Diameter growth responses were analyzed in connection with long-term deviations of climatic characteristics. The effect of different stand density on diameter growth response in relation to climate situations was evaluated by cluster analysis and the variability of diameter growth response to climate situations was interpreted by the variance of correlation coefficients in groups of sample trees. The investigation confirmed the significant negative effect of meteorological drought on diameter increment of studied pine stands in the period of the last 30 years. At the same time, we observed a significant positive influence of higher spring (February, March) air temperatures on the annual diameter growth of dominant trees. The effect of stand density (in thinned stands) on the relation between diameter growth and climatic characteristic was not significant.},

An annual growth model was developed in this study that predicts yield based on information from the previous year.

Bark thickness, compass direction, stem diameter at breast height, bark moisture content and relative height of the sample in the stem were tested for their effect on heat insulation capacity of bark. Trees were felled and heating experiments were conducted at 400 ºC on fresh billets with intact bark. Time to heat the cambium to lethal 60 ºC was determined. Statistical analysis based on correlation, multi-model inference and multiple regression revealed no significant influence of compass direction and diameter at breast height. Heat resistance was mainly determined by bark thickness, to a lesser degree by moisture content. In several species relative height at the stem modulated the bark thickness effect. Higher up the stem bark of the same thickness offered less protection against heat. Significant species-specific differences in heat resistance were apparent in the results, which could not be explained by bark thickness thus indicating further need for research in scrutinising these factors, which might help to explain the relative higher fire tolerance of certain species compared to others.},

Here, we implement an approach to identify locally appropriate adaptation options by tapping into the experiential knowledge base of local forest practitioners while at the same time, building capacity within this community to implement the results. We engaged 30 forest practitioners who are involved with the implementation of a regional forest management plan in identifying climate change vulnerabilities and evaluating alternative adaptation options.

  abstract = {1. Large differences exist in the predictions of plant responses to climate change among models that consider population variation and those that do not. Models that treat species as homogeneous entities typically predict net positive impacts of climate change on temperate forest productivity, while most studies that consider adaptive genetic variation within species conclude that the impacts of climate change on forest productivity will be negative. 2. We present a modelling approach that predicts plant responses to climate change using both ecological and genetic variables. The model uses growth data from multi-site provenance trials together with climate data for provenance source locations and test sites to predict distribution and productivity of tree populations under climate change. We used an extensive lodgepole pine Pinus contorta provenance data set to illustrate the model. 3. Spatially explicit predictions of the impacts of climate change on production were developed and suggested that different populations of lodgepole pine will respond very differently to climate change. Large production losses will be seen in many areas, although modest production increases may occur in some areas by 2085. The model further projects a significant redistribution of the species' potential habitat northwards and upwards in altitude over the next several decades. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study points to the need to consider population differences when modelling biotic responses to climate change, and suggests that climate change will render populations maladapted in many areas. The model also provides a key tool potentially to mitigate climate change impacts by identifying populations expected to be best adapted throughout the next generation of forests. Finally, the study highlights the value of wide-ranging long-term provenance tests in addressing key issues in ecology and climate change.},

  abstract = {Changes to forest growth models used widely in global change research and sustainable forest management are needed to account for expected climate change impacts. We provide a new approach that dynamically merges height-age functions prevalent in forest growth models with transfer functions prevalent in population adaptation research to better represent changes to forest productivity as climates gradually change. Our simulations with data from an extensive provenance test of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in British Columbia, Canada, suggest that climate change will reduce production in lodgepole pine forests established today by at least 7-13% at the end of this century considerably less than most predictions based solely on transfer or response functions, which do not integrate impacts as climate gradually changes. This work illustrates the need for forest productivity models to consider the changing climate in which a population is growing relative to the static climate of its origin. It also demonstrates the value of long-term provenance trials in assessing the dynamic impact of climate change on forest productivity, and serves as an example of how provenance trials may be exploited in other forest productivity models or other research fields to assess plant responses to climate.},

However, the performance of these statistics has not been fully demonstrated either analytically or through simulations. We report results of simulations to asses the ability of these statistics to select the most parsimonious model. R 2 statistics from a full model were compared to other models in which fixed-effect covariates were removed. The full model was also compared to an overfitted model that included additional covariates not linked to the outcome. All models compared involved the same random effects. In this paper, we show that R 2 statistics that involve the residuals are unable to adequately discriminate between the correct model and one from which important fixed-effect covariates are omitted if the computation of the predicted values for the residuals included the random effects (referred to as conditional R 2 statistics). However, if the random effects are excluded from the computation of the predicted values that lead to the residuals, these R 2 statistics (referred to as marginal R 2 statistics) are able to select the most parsimonious model. Other R 2 statistics that have been proposed by Xu [2003. Measuring explained variation in linear mixed effects models. Statist.

  abstract = {Radial growth responses to drought were examined in the tree-ring records of six species growing within two locations of differing land-use history and soil moisture characteristics, and in overstory and understory canopy positions in northern Virginia. Tree species experienced differential ring-width reductions during or immediately following four severe drought periods occurring from 1930 to 1965 and were influenced by climatic variables including annual and summer temperatures, annual precipitation, and annual Palmer Drought Severity Index. Relative growth comparisons averaged across species before and after drought years indicated that understory trees on dry-mesic sites grew 11% faster after drought compared to predrought rates while mesic site trees in both canopy positions grew approximately 4% slower. Superposed epoch analysis indicated that Liriodendron tulipifera growing on mesic sites experienced greater ring-width reductions associated with drought than co-occurring, more drought-tolerant Quercus alba and Q. velutina. On dry-mesic sites, L. tulipifera also experienced greatly reduced growth as a result of drought but exhibited significant growth increases following individual drought events. Quercus alba was the only species that exhibited a consistent, significant ring width decrease associated with all droughts on dry-mesic sites. In contrast, Pinus virginiana was least impacted by drought on dry-mesic sites but was much more impacted by drought on mesic sites, indicating a drought x site interaction for this species. Overstory Carya glabra and Q. alba experienced larger growth decreases during drought on dry-mesic versus mesic sites. Understory tree growth reductions did not differ between site types but were often significantly larger than overstory responses of the same species on mesic sites. Following drought, most trees exhibited growth reductions lasting 2-3 years, although several species experienced reductions lasting up to 6 years. The results of this study suggest that tree rings represent an important long-term proxy for leaf-level ecophysiological measurements of growth responses to drought periods.},

  abstract = {Growth and development of individual Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco) were studied on the basis of a sample of 44 trees felled in the north east of France, taking into consideration various stand conditions. This work was conducted with a view to future use of the information in a simulation system, to predict the effects of silvicultural treatments on Douglas fir stands. Stem and branches were analysed in all trees, and relationships combining branch growth with growth and development of crown and stem were obtained. These relationships give insight into interactions between tree growth and stand dynamics. Among the prediction equations obtained, a major one was tested on a further 12 newly felled trees, analysed for past bole increments and crown development reconstruction. This suggested the use of a scaling factor to correct a possible underestimation.},

The model is constructed from submodels that predict an individual tree's growth, survival, dispersal, and recruitment, and submodels that predict the local availability of resources. Competition is entirely mechanistic; plants interfere with one another only by depleting resources. We also describe maximum likelihood methods for estimating each of the submodels from data collected in the field. Over the past two years, we collected the necessary data for the dominant tree species in the Great Mountain Forest (Norfolk, Conn.). We report estimates of submodels for each species, and show that the calibrated population dynamic model predicts the structure and dynamics of natural forests. Finally, we contrast our model with the JABOWA–FORET family of forest models.},

Growth of saplings in the field is regressed against measures of whole-season light availability, soil moisture, and sapling size. Statistical tests show strong effects of light availability on growth, but no significant effects of soil moisture. Comparison of the light-dependent growth functions for the 10 species revealed three apparent interspecific trade-offs. (i) Species growing quickly at high light tended to grow slowly at low light and vice versa. The order of species from fast growing at high light to fast growing at low light did not correspond to traditional classifications of shade tolerance, and variation along this axis was approximately continuous. (ii) There was substantial variation off the species continuum defined in i. At any point along the continuum from fast growth at high light to fast growth at low light, some species grew faster than others, and these faster growing species had lower survivorship during periods of suppression than the slower growing species. (iii) Height growth at high light was inversely related to survivorship when suppressed. This variation was again continuous (species did not cluster into discrete categories), but the order of the species did correspond closely to a traditional ordering of shade tolerance. There was little correspondence between our estimated growth functions and the growth functions assumed in the JABOWA-FORET class of forest simulation models. These results raise serious concerns about the current practice of assigning growth functions to species in simulation models using traditional classifications of shade tolerance.},

We analyzed the effects of competition on tree growth along environmental gradients for eight of the most common tree species in southern New England and southeastern New York using forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data, information theoretic decision criteria, and multi-model inference to evaluate models. The suite of models estimated growth of individual trees as a species-specific function of average potential diameter growth, tree diameter at breast height, local environmental conditions, and crowding by neighboring trees. We used ordination based on the relative basal area of species to generate a measure of site conditions in each plot. Two ordination axes were consistent with variation in species abundance along moisture and fertility gradients. Estimated potential growth varied along at least one of these axes for six of the eight species; peak relative abundance of less shade-tolerant species was in all cases displaced away from sites where they showed maximum potential growth. Our crowding functions estimate the strength of competitive effects of neighbors; only one species showed support for the hypothesis that all species of competitors have equivalent effects on growth. The relative weight of evidence (Akaike weights) for the best models varied from a low of 0.207 for Fraxinus americana to 0.747 for Quercus rubra. In such cases, model averaging provides a more robust platform for prediction than that based solely on the best model. We show that predictions based on the selected best models dramatically overestimated differences between species relative to predictions based on the averaged set of models.},

Resilience is the concept du jour, and is increasingly employed as a catch-all term for a variety of management goals. There is peril in making excessive use of buzzwords as stand-ins for the complex goals that are the real target of forest management. In this paper, I explore the consequences of buzzword mutation, which leads to paradigm creep the use of buzzwords far beyond their original sphere of application. Such inappropriate use threatens to dilute the meaning of the original metaphor and makes talking clearly about the legitimate targets of forest management more difficult. I use "sustainable development" as an exemplar of a buzzword that has mutated into uselessness. I then compare the descent of sustainable development with current trends in the use of "resilience", and offer some guidelines for rescuing this term from a similar fate.},

  abstract = {Abstract Climate is a driver of biotic systems. It affects individual fitness, population dynamics, distribution and abundance of species, and ecosystem structure and function. Regional variation in climatic regimes creates selective pressures for the evolution of locally adapted physiologies, morphological adaptations (e.g., color patterns, surface textures, body shapes and sizes), and behavioral adaptations (e.g., foraging strategies and breeding systems). In the absence of humans, broad?scale, long?term consequences of climatic warming on wild organisms are generally predictable. Evidence from Pleistocene glaciations indicates that most species responded ecologically by shifting their ranges poleward and upward in elevation, rather than evolutionary through local adaptation (e.g., morphological changes). But these broad patterns tell us little about the relative importance of gradual climatic trends as compared to extreme weather events in shaping these processes. Here, evidence is brought forward that extreme weather events can be implicated as mechanistic drivers of broad ecological responses to climatic trends. They are, therefore, essential to include in predictive biological models, such as doubled CO2 scenarios.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the impact of drought measured on different time-scales on radial growth of eight tree species during the period 1950-2005 growing across a wide climatic gradient encompassing semiarid Mediterranean woodlands and wet mountain forests in north-eastern Spain. A drought index (standardized precipitation index. SPI) at different time scales (1-48 months) was correlated with chronologies of ring width to determine the significant time scale at which drought affected most tree growth. The findings indicated that the impact of drought on growth varied noticeably among species and sites. Two distinct patterns were clearly observed considering spatial and temporal differences in the response of species to drought. Species growing in xeric sites (Pinus and Quercus species and Juniperus thurifera) showed the highest responses to SPI time-scales of 9-11 months while those located in mesic sites (Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris) did respond more to SPI time scales shorter than 5 months. The SPI-growth correlations were significant, although weak, up to 30 months in xeric sites while no consistent association was observed at higher time scales. Important seasonal differences were noticed in the SPI-growth associations. Species growing in xeric areas responded to spring-summer SPI while those distributed in mesic sites responded more to summer SPI. Our findings should be useful to understand forest responses to climate change, including an increasing frequency of severe droughts, and to adapt appropriate management strategies to mitigate the impact of drought on tree growth.

Much of the confusion on the measurement and interpretation of nutrient use efficiency results from the lack of a sound theoretical basis with which to examine experimental results. In this paper, we develop a theory of nutrient use efficiency based upon fundamental mass balance, present a graphical approach to appropriate testing of alternative hypotheses to avoid problems of autocorrelation in data, and suggest critical areas where experiments must be performed to distinguish among hypotheses. We show that nutrient use efficiency (production per unit nutrient uptake) must be distinguished from nutrient response efficiency (production per unit nutrient available). In contrast to the monotonic increase of nutrient use efficiency with decreasing nutrient availability originally proposed in the 1982 model of P.M. Vitousek, nutrient response efficiency is unimodal with maximum efficiency at intermediate levels of nutrient availability. However, nutrient use efficiency dynamics at low nutrient availability cannot yet be theoretically defined. We also show theoretically which plant traits control responses of ecosystem nutrient use or nutrient response efficiency along gradients of nutrient availability. Finally, we show how our model naturally leads to species replacement along nutrient availability gradients.},

  abstract = {Growth refers to an increase in dimensions with time and is implicit in the expected continual increase in tree dimensions. Tree diameters, however, could decrease during the growing season due to water depletion. Annual negative growth measurements are usually attributed to human error and not to other physiological or physical processes. Although seasonal and diurnal fluctuations of diameter have been well documented, perennial decrement of diameter has not been the focus of physiological research. The aim of this work was to analyse the potential causes of decrease in annual diameter growth related to tree mortality due to self-thinning in Nothofagus pumilio forests and to quantify the variations in water depletion of the tree trunks. Some trees did present negative annual diameter increments associated with a water content decrease in the trunks (77 per cent in live trees compared with 56 per cent in recently dead individuals), which produced a contraction (more than 8 per cent of the initial diameter) in the wood and the bark. Trees could survive during 2–5 growth seasons with continual decreases in their diameters (14 per cent, standard error 5 per cent of the trees in the studied stand) until the water content reached a limit where mortality resulted. Therefore, the occurrence of data showing a diameter decrease in successive forest inventories may be due to physiological and physical processes in the natural dynamics of the stand, and not exclusively be explained away as the results of human measurement errors.},

  abstract = {1. Quadratic entropy (QE) was developed as a fundamental function for measuring the diversity within a collection, such as a community, or population, from indices of abundance and distance among categories, such as species or alleles. Based on a literature review in the fields of genetics, ecology and statistics and new developments, I analyse the potential of this function for biodiversity studies. 2. Quadratic entropy was established as a generalisation of well-known diversity indices, and has been widely used in molecular ecology and genetics research. It is now integrated within more general frameworks for analysing functional and phylogenetic diversity in ecology. 3. Quadratic entropy can be maximised by removing categories, and several collections can share the maximum diversity, even with highly distinct compositions. Clarifying these statements, I identify all potential indices of the abundance of the categories that maximise QE. 4. By quantifying changes in diversity when mixing collections together, QE can measure differences among collections. Here, I provide a geometric interpretation of these differences that demonstrates their relevance as classical geometric distances. 5. A critical aspect of these distances is obtained if QE is strictly concave; that is, diversity always strictly increases by mixing distinct collections together. More generally, QE can be used to evaluate the effects of various factors on diversity in a framework designated ANOQE (analysis of QE). Generalising ANOVA (analysis of variance), ANOQE uses QE to measure distances between centroids. 6. Importantly, QE is estimated from sampled data and thus requires estimators. Based on these estimators, tests have been developed to compare levels of diversity. Tests of factor effects are evaluated by parametric, jackknife, bootstrap and permutational approaches. However, the procedures associated with these tests that have been suggested thus far only treat a few factors. 7. There is an urgent need for the development of such approaches in biology to deal with experimental factors, observed population and community structure, and different spatial and temporal scales. Together, QE and the ANOQE procedure are likely to have a critical impact on all scientific disciplines interested in any form of diversity.},

However, complex simulation models can have a role that is different from that of simpler models that are designed to be fit to data. Simulation can be viewed as another kind of experimental system and should be analyzed as such. Here, I argue that current discussions in the philosophy of science and in the physical sciences fields about the use of simulation as an experimental system have important implications for biology, especially complex sciences such as evolution and ecology. Simulation models can be used to mimic complex systems, but unlike nature, can be manipulated in ways that would be impossible, too costly or unethical to do in natural systems. Simulation can add to theory development and testing, can offer hypotheses about the way the world works and can give guidance as to which data are most important to gather experimentally.},

  abstract = {Growth and yield modeling has a long history in forestry. Methods of measuring the growth of uneven-aged forest stands have evolved from those developed in France and Switzerland during the last century. Furthermore, uneven-aged growth and yield modeling has processed rapidly since the first models were pioneered by Moser and Hall (1969) (Moser Jr., J.W., Hall, O.F., 1969. For Sci. 15, 183-188). Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands using both individual and stand-level approaches. Modeling methodology not only has moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based mechanistic approach, but also has incorporated a variety of techniques, such as, (1) systems of equations, (2) nonlinear stand table projections, (3) Markov chains, (4) matrix models, and (5) artificial neural network models. However, modeling the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands has received much less attention than that of even-aged stands. This paper reviews the current literature regarding growth and yield models for uneven-aged stands, discusses basic types of models and their merits, and reports recent progress in modeling the growth and dynamics of uneven-aged stands. Furthermore, future trends involving integration of new computer technologies (object-oriented programming and user-friendly interfaces), tree visualization techniques. and the spatially explicit application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) into uneven-aged modeling strategies are discussed.

  abstract = {Context The suitability of thinning to prevent forest growth decline as a result of global warming has not been tested extensively in Macaronesian Canary pine (Pinus canariensis Sweet ex Spreng.). Aims This study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) are tree growth patterns modified by the aspect and thinning intensity? (2) Is sensitivity to climate modulated by thinning? (3) Do trees of different crown classes respond differentially to thinning intensity and climate? Methods We used tree-ring series from dominant, codominant, and overtopped trees to study the effects of thinning intensity on basal area increments (BAI) and climate sensitivity on windward (wet) and leeward (dry) slopes on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Three replicated blocks of control, light thinning, and heavy thinning stands were set on each slope in 1988, and cores were extracted in 2007. Results Heavy thinning induced growth release and increased BAI, mainly on dominant and codominant trees, whereas light thinning effects were negligible; their impacts were more intense on the windward side. Temperature sensitivity was hardly affected by thinning on leeward, where climate control was stronger. On windward, thinning enhanced the influence of summer temperatures. Upper crown classes were more sensitive overall, but overtopped trees responded better in summer. Thinning intensity and aspect greatly influence growth on Canary pine afforestations, but individual responses are highly dependent on crown classes. In addition, thinning may be less effective to modify growth conditions on leeward slopes, at least if not intense.},

disadvantage compared to those surrounded by oak. The model was integrated in a module of the Capsis forest

  abstract = {It is widely believed that distance-independent tree models fail to take into account the complexity of mixed stands due to the fact that spatial structure often has a greater impact on growth and dynamics in mixed stands than in pure stands. On the other hand, distance-dependent tree models are difficult to use because they require a map of the stand, which is not only very costly but also impracticable in a routine management context. This paper reports the development of a model bridging distance-dependent and distance-independent tree models, and that is designed to simulate the growth of a mixed forest. The model used distributions of the number of neighbours to reconstruct tree neighbourhoods and compute the competition indices needed as inputs to the growth model. Data were collected from a mixed forest of sessile oak and Scots pine in central France. The study showed that local competition indices explained a significant proportion of growth variability and that intraspecific competition was greater than interspecific competition. The model based on neighbourhood distributions gave consistent predictions compared to a distance-dependent model. This type of model could be used instead of distance-dependent models in management contexts.},

  abstract = {Growth compensations following a disturbance have been found in different species communities through experimentation, but there are few results obtained in natural conditions, in particular for forest ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine whether there was growth compensation in a mixed oak-pine forest following a biotic disturbance: an outbreak of pine sawfly (Diprion pini) that caused massive defoliation of pines in Europe in the early 1980s. The data were collected in mixed oak-pine stands located in the plains of north-central France. We measured the ring widths of 223 oaks and 271 pines in nine mixed stands over a period ranging from 1972 to 2005. We established a model which incorporated climatic effects in order to predict the ring width under undisturbed conditions and to quantify the response of each species to the disturbance. We found that the growth of both species varied synchronously with a positive covariation outside of the disturbance. During the disturbance, the growth of both species covaried negatively especially in the plots where pine had been the most severely affected. For the year following the peak of the defoliations, the reduction in growth for pine was strong and ranged from -27% to -92% depending on the plot. In addition, the more significant the reduction in growth for pine, the more significant the increase in growth for oak. We found that a 100% reduction in pine growth was accompanied by a 61% increase in oak growth for the three years following the most severe defoliation. These results demonstrate that compensation between the two tree species following the insect outbreak did occur. We suggest that growth compensations would especially occur in the case of severe biotic disturbances but probably not in the case of climatic fluctuations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Many mature beeches were killed immediately or severly damaged. Growth of survivors was negligible until about 1985 and never recovered to pre-drought rates. Damaged trees were still dying 15 years later from drought-induced damage. Sub-canopy beech in those parts of the wood which suffered most canopy mortality grew rapidly after 1983. Through its effects on beech, the drought had a marked impact on the structure and successional trajectory of the wood},

  abstract = {Abstract Models based on allometric responses to competing neighbours and environmental conditions in mangrove forests are increasingly available. However, the improvement of these models requires a mechanistic understanding of how individual trees allocate biomass. This study introduces a new tree model (BETTINA) focusing on this issue. It is designed to investigate the response of trees in terms of biomass allocation patterns to environmental conditions. Additionally, it is suitable as a component of an individual-based mangrove stand model. BETTINA describes the plasticity of trees in growth patterns depending on their below-ground resource uptake. In contrast to the existing mangrove stand models, BETTINA focusses explicitly on the processes leading to variation in resource availability. Based on the physical principle of osmotic potential of solutions, the direct influence of salinity on plant water availability is considered. Allometric model parameters are not restricted to only the above-ground measures of trees’ traits (such as stem diameter and height), but also characterize below-ground biomass. Within BETTINA these measures are not limited to predefined empirical maximum values, but are the result of and depend on environmental conditions. The model is suitable to explain allometric measures and relations in dependence on total plant size and environmental conditions (for now salinity and light), and has a great potential for a physiologically and physically based improvement of plant component related biomass estimations.},

This index in oak and beech increases only by a half value of the value for spruce. Precipitation from the second half of the vegetation period of the previous year is also important. Higher temperatures during the vegetation period affect increment changes mostly negatively.

  abstract = {The record-breaking heat-wave in summer 2003 was expected to have a strong impact on tree growth, especially where trees occur at their ecological limits. We studied radial growth response of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) exposed to dry inner Alpine climate (Tyrol, Austria) to extreme hot and dry conditions in 2003. Tree ring chronologies from two stands comprising different social status, i.e. dominant, co-dominant and suppressed trees, on a south- and north-facing slope, which represent xeric and dry-mesic site conditions, respectively, were analysed. Growth-climate relationships were explored using response function analysis and Pearson correlation coefficients. Major findings of our study were: (i) radial growth in 2003 was strongest reduced in suppressed P. sylvestris growing on a xeric site and in dominant Picea abies growing on the dry-mesic site, (ii) median reductions in annual increments reached 35% compared to previous years (1998-2002) and were caused by early stop of cambial activity as indicated by pronounced decrease in latewood width and (iii) April through June precipitation was the environmental factor most strongly associated with growth of both species. Ring width of P. sylvestris and Picea abies was additionally limited by hot late spring and hot late spring/summer months, respectively. The minor impact of the 2003 summer heat-wave on growth of drought exposed forest trees might find its explanation in strong dependency of radial stem growth on precipitation during late spring and preconditioning of tree vigor in previous years. Results demonstrate that impact of climate extremes on radial tree growth can vary within site and canopy position and strongly depend on species-specific response to climate factors.

Solar radiation is a fundamental component of ecological processes, but is poorly used at this scale due to the lack of available data. Here we present a GIS program allowing to calculate solar radiation as well locally as at large scale, taking into account both topographical (slope, aspect, altitude, shadowing) and global (cloudiness and latitude) parameters. This model was applied to the whole of France (540 000 km(2)) for each month of the year, using only a 50-m digital elevation model (DEM), latitude values and cloudiness data. Solar radiation measured from 88 meteorological stations used for validation indicated a R-2 of 0.78 between measured and predicted annual radiation with better predictions for winter than for summer. Radiation values increase with altitude, and with slope for southern exposure, excepted in summer. They decrease with latitude, nebulosity, and slope for north, east, and west exposures. The effect of cloudiness is important, and reduces radiation by around 20% in winter and 10% in summer. Models of plant distribution were calculated for Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus, and Quercus pubescens, for France. The use of solar radiation improved modelling for the three species models directly or through the water balance variable. We conclude that models which incorporates both topographical and global variability of solar radiation can improve efficiency of large-scale models of plant distribution.},

  abstract = {Ecological studies require environmental descriptors to establish the response of species or communities to ecological conditions. The soil water resource is an important factor, but it is difficult for plant ecologists to use because of the lack of accessible data. We explored whether collecting a large number of plots with basic soil information within the framework of forest inventories would make it possible to map the soil water holding capacity (SWHC) with sufficient accuracy to predict tree species growth over large areas. We first compared the performance of the available pedotransfer functions (PTFs) and found significant differences in the SWHC prediction quality based on the PTFs selected. We also found that the most efficient class PTFs and continuous PTFs compared had similar performances. However, there was a significant reduction in efficiency when they were applied to soils that were different from those used to calibrate them. With a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.046 cm(3) cm(-3) (n = 227 horizons), we selected the Al Majou class PTFs to predict the SWHC in the soil horizons described in every plot. Thus, 84% of the measured SWHC variance have been explained in soils that were free of stones (n = 63 plots). We then estimated the soil water holding capacity by integrating the stone content collected at the soil pit scale (SWHC') and both the stone content at the soil pit scale and rock outcrop at the plot scale (SWHC") for the 100,307 forest plots recorded in France within the framework of forest inventories. The SWHC" values were interpolated by kriging to produce a map with a 1-km(2) cell size, a wider resolution leading to a decrease in map accuracy. The SWHC" values given by the map ranged from 0 to 148 mm for soil down to a depth of 1 m. The RMSE between the map values and plot estimates was 33.9 mm for the entire France, with a prediction accuracy similar for a large range of scale, the best predictions being recorded for soils developed on marl, clay, and hollow silicate rocks, and in flat areas. Finally, the abilities of SWHC' and SWHC" to predict height growth for Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Quercus petraea were investigated, and we found that the predictive ability of SWHC" was much better than that of SWHC'. The SWHC" values extracted from the map were significantly related to tree height growth. They explained 10.7% of the height growth index variance for Beech (Fagus sylvatica, n = 866), 14.1% for Sessile oak (Quercus petraea, n = 877), and 10.3% for Norway spruce (Picea abies, n = 2067). These proportions of variance accounted by SWHC" were close to those found for the SWHC" values estimated from the plots (11.5, 11.7, and 18.6% for Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, and Picea abies, respectively). We conclude that SWHC" can be mapped with sufficient accuracy to predict species growth using basic soil parameters collected from inventories plots. Thus, the map could be used just as well for small areas as for large areas, directly or indirectly through water balance indices, to predict forest growth and thus production, today or in the future, in the context of an increasing drought period linked to a global change in climatic conditions.

Karst.) tree data and experimental plots in slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations of different initial stocking densities. Further analyses led to potentially useful generalizations concerning basal area growth and yield of even-aged stands. Hypotheses are developed, in terms of the parameters of the Chapman-Richards growth model, for unthinned even-aged stands. These, in turn, provide a basis for extension to thinned even-aged stands. Briefly, with estimates of the model parameters for a given species and site class, and with the growth-rate parameter related to initial stocking in unthinned stands, the basal area development of stands of different initial stocking and subsequent thinning regimes can be predicted.

  abstract = {In mixed stands, abiotic effects and interspecific interactions on tree height growth remain largely unknown. We investigated the effects of climate, nutrition and stand composition on silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) height growth in the Vosges Mountains (northeastern France). Data were collected from 143 plots established on seven stand types of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.): pure silver fir stands and six mixed stands of silver fir with Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus petraea and Acer pseudoplatanus, along both elevation and nutritional gradients. Silver fir dominant height was characterised by the site index, which was related by multiple-regression analyses with measured nutritional variables, climatic variables and stand composition descriptors. The results showed that silver fir site index was significantly correlated with climate, nutrition and stand composition. Among climatic variables, elevation was responsible for a large portion of the site index variance (R-2 = 0.13). Slope aspect showed an important positive effect of eastern oriented plots on silver fir site index, as did mild winter temperature. Variables related to water availability showed a positive effect on site index only at elevations below 600 m, where lower precipitations and higher temperatures lead to a water-limiting factor. Nutritional resources were the second factor determining silver fir site index by both nitrogen nutrition and protons and aluminium acidity or toxicity. An environmental model, including climatic and nutritional variables, explained 64% of site index variance with a standard error of 2.7 m. For equivalent sites, basal area of the dominant cohort, as well as basal area of conifer species, showed a positive effect on site index, while broadleaved basal area did not show any significant effect in addition to that of conifers. A final model including abiotic variables and conifer basal area explains 71% of site index variance with a standard error of 2.5 m in the study area. The search for ecological drivers of tree height that control access to light is of great importance in the context of environmental changes in predicting tree species relationships in mixed stands.

  abstract = {In dendroclimatology, trees growing at low competition level are often sampled, to avoid the effects of competition on tree growth. But trees generally live in dense stands, and the analysis of the climatic response should take into consideration the intraspecific relations, because competition could affect resource availability and climate sensitivity. To analyze the climate-competition interactions, 74 trees were cored in a pure even-aged beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. A distance-dependent growth model was used to quantify competition as the source of growth variability in ring-width series, providing a statistical interpretation of growth trend and competition signal, while residuals were considered as climatic perturbation. The ratio between observed and predicted basal area increment (BAI) for the period 1974-1993 was utilized as a growth index. Correlation functions computed between growth indices and monthly climatic variables show that BAI responses to climate vary with competition. Correlation coefficients between temperature and growth indices change from positive to negative as competition increases, whereas precipitation shows an opposite trend. Similarly, correlation with yearly water deficits shows a negative trend, while correlation with water surplus increases. The quantitative analysis of the climate- competition interactions may establish a link between forest management and tree response to climate change.},

Riparian species were obligate riparian trees (Fraxinus velutina, Populus fremontii, and Salix gooddingii), native shrubs (Baccharis spp.), and an exotic shrub (Tamarix ramosissima). Upland species were evergreen (Juniperus monosperma, Larrea tridentata), drought-deciduous (Ambrosia dumosa, Encelia farinosa, Fouquieria splendens, Cercidium microphyllum), and winter-deciduous (Acacia spp., Prosopis velutina) trees and shrubs. For each species, we measured the “vulnerability curve” of stem xylem, which shows the decrease in hydraulic conductance from cavitation as a function of Ψx and the Ψcrit representing the pressure at complete loss of transport. We also measured minimum in situ Ψx(Ψxmin) during the summer drought. Species in desert upland sites were uniformly less vulnerable to cavitation and exhibited lower Ψxmin than riparian species. Values of Ψcrit were correlated with minimum Ψx. Safety margins (Ψxmin–Ψcrit) tended to increase with decreasing Ψxmin and were small enough that the relatively vulnerable riparian species could not have conducted water at the Ψx experienced in upland habitats (−4 to −10 MPa). Maintenance of positive safety margins in riparian and upland habitats was associated with minimal to no increase in stem cavitation during the summer drought. The absence of less vulnerable species from the riparian zone may have resulted in part from a weak but significant trade-off between decreasing vulnerability to cavitation and conducting efficiency. These data suggest that cavitation vulnerability limits plant distribution by defining maximum drought tolerance across habitats and influencing competitive ability of drought tolerant species in mesic habitats.},

In addition, correlation functions - developed initially for problems outside forestry - enable analysis and characterization of forest stand structures, generating more accessible information. This paper outlines a classification of structural indices measuring alpha diversity and examines typical representatives of the classification groups such as the Shannon index, the aggregation index of Clark and Evans, the contagion index, the coefficient of segregation of Pielou, the mingling index, the diameter differentiation index, the pair correlation and the mark correlation function. These can be used to measure differences between forests in time and space, to generate forest structures, to analyse the differences between observed and expected structures and to characterize modifications of forest structure resulting from selective harvesting. These algorithms are the keys for assessing complex forest structures, which can be the result of continuous cover forestry methods. Continuous cover forests with selective harvesting are being promoted in the new forest policies of Britain. Case studies have shown that from given spatial forest structures one can possibly conclude the suitability for habitats, a hypothesis which has yet to be proved by further appropriate analysis. The equations for the quantification of stand structure presented in this paper have the advantage that they are easier to survey during forest inventory than the more direct measures of ecological variety.},

  abstract = {Spatial forest structure research can be considered as a special branch or application of point process statistics and therefore ties into general concepts and theories. According to them, species mingling and diameter differentiation indices, also referred to as nearest neighbour summary characteristics (NNSS), are based on constructed marks. Interestingly the construction principles of marks share similarities with the principles of the construction of test functions of second-order characteristics. By defining species mingling and diameter differentiation as second-order characteristics the authors showed that successful concepts of structural indices can indeed be transferred to other, more powerful statistical concepts. The new mark mingling and mark differentiation functions were then applied to Poisson point processes with independent and dependent marking and also to marked point pattern data from two forests. The analyses clearly highlighted that the new second-order characteristics, which are based on the same principles of comparing tree attributes as the traditional indices, significantly add to the value of the simple mark distributions. This compatibility of mark and test function construction works both ways and the principles of the test functions of the mark correlation function and the mark variogram can for example be used to construct mark correlation and mark variogram indices as NNSS. This provides the analyst with the flexibility to use second-order characteristics if large observation windows with more than 100 points are available and the corresponding mark or index distributions in the case of small observation windows with only few points, a common situation in forest inventory. And yet, the algorithmic principles of comparing tree attributes are then the same.},

  abstract = {Many different spatio-temporal individual-based models (IBM) for forests have been developed for studying the development of trees in space and time. Such models typically depend on various numerical parameters that represent the ecological processes of growth (G), inter-plant competition (C) and birth-and-death (B & D; also called regeneration and mortality). Until now little work has been done to systematically trace the influence of these processes and their model parameters on the spatial structure of forest ecosystems. This paper attempts to fill this gap by addressing an important aspect of forest structure, spatial variability, characterised by the mark variogram as a summary characteristic. The model used was inspired by components of various well-established IBMs including a shot-noise competition field. Time series data from monospecies forests in three different countries of the northern hemisphere provided ecological reference scenarios. Though a case study, the paper's methodology is rather general and can be applied to any model and forest ecosystem. Methods of sensitivity analysis revealed that only a small number of model parameters is crucial for forming spatial variability. Particularly important is the range of competition between trees; with increasing range the variability increases. Growth processes have considerable importance particularly with short observation periods and in young forests, whereas mortality processes become more influential in the long-term. Naturally, these statements depend upon the initial structure and on the length of the observation period. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Both traditional competition indices and competition kernels are used in many studies to quantify competition between plants for resources. Yet it is not fully clear what the differences between these two concepts really are. For characterising the two approaches we selected two fundamental types of competition indices based on distance weighted size ratios, an additional competition index without distance weighting and developed similar competition kernels. In contrast to the latter approach, competition indices require individual influence zones that for example can be derived from tree crown-radius measurements. We applied these competition measures to two spatio-temporal forest datasets in Europe and one in North America. Stem diameter increment served as observed response variable. The results of both methods indicated similar performance, however, the use of competition kernels produced slightly better results with only one exception out of six computer experiments. Although the performance of both competition measures is not too different, competition kernels are based on more solid mathematical and ecological grounds. Particularly the question of defining the local neighbourhood of a given tree seems to be better handled by competition kernels. Consequently, applications of this method are likely to increase. The trade-off of the use of competition kernels, however, is the need for more sophisticated spatial regression routines that researchers are required to program. Finally, a tabulated summary of differences between competition indices and competition kernels is included.},

The use of relative growth rates, involving the analysis of plant growth relative to plant size, has more or less independently emerged in different research groups and at different times and has provided powerful tools for assessing the growth performance and growth efficiency of plants and plant populations. In this paper, we explore how these isolated methods can be combined to form a consistent methodology for modelling relative growth rates.METHODS:We review and combine existing methods of analysing and modelling relative growth rates and apply a combination of methods to Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) stem-analysis data from North Wales (UK) and British Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) yield table data.RESULTS:The results indicate that, by combining the approaches of different plant-growth analysis laboratories and using them simultaneously, we can advance and standardise the concept of relative plant growth. Particularly the growth multiplier plays an important role in modelling relative growth rates. Another useful technique has been the recent introduction of size-standardised relative growth rates.CONCLUSIONS:Modelling relative growth rates mainly serves two purposes, 1) an improved analysis of growth performance and efficiency and 2) the prediction of future or past growth rates. This makes the concept of relative growth ideally suited to growth reconstruction as required in dendrochronology, climate change and forest decline research and for interdisciplinary research projects beyond the realm of plant science.},

  abstract = {The concept of relative growth has independently been developed and pursued in different fields of science and at different locations. It has proved to be useful in comparative studies of plant growth analysis. The purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of different independent approaches as well as of research applications and to standardise the mathematical notation in order to facilitate future research. In the context of ecology, we explore and analyse the definitions of absolute and relative growth rates, growth acceleration, growth multipliers and allometry from a mathematical point of view. In addition, we evaluate statements made in the literature, compare different concepts that have been developed separately and show how they relate to each other. We also review and standardise functions of absolute and relative growth, which can be used for analysing and modelling plant growth. Finally, we comment on sampling, growth rate combinations and the recently discussed method of size standardisation. We conclude that the different approaches to quantifying and modelling relative growth rates can conveniently be integrated in one consistent theoretical concept and as a result provide useful synergies. A harmonisation of different definitions of relative growth rate is straightforward and a consistent, meaningful notation provides a deeper understanding of the concept. Relative growth rates are key characteristics for assessing growth performance and growth efficiency. Recently they have gained importance for diagnosing and modelling mortality and reproduction processes and they potentially play a crucial role in reconstructing growth processes in dendrochronology, climate change and forest decline research. From a technical point of view, relative growth rates are more straightforward to model than absolute growth rates and more emphasis should be devoted to model development.},

In this Study we compare 22 architectural traits for 54 Bolivian moist-forest tree species. We evaluate how architectural traits related to H-max vary with tree size, and we present a conceptual scheme in which we combine the two axes into four different functional groups. Interspecific correlations between architecture and H a, varied strongly from negative to positive, depending on the reference sizes used. Stem height was positively related to H-max at larger reference diameters (14-80 cm). Species height vs. diameter curves often flattened toward their upper ends in association with reproductive maturity for species of all sizes. Thus, adult understory trees were typically shorter than similar-diameter juveniles of larger species. Crown area was negatively correlated with H-max at small reference heights and positively correlated at larger reference heights (15-34 m). Wide crowns allow the small understory species to intercept light over a large area at the expense of a reduced height growth. Crown length was negatively correlated with H-max at intermediate reference heights (4-14 m). A long crown enables small understory species to maximize light interception in a light-limited environment. Light-demanding species were characterized by orthotropic stems and branches, large leaves, and a monolayer leaf arrangement. They realized an efficient height growth through the formation of narrow and shallow crowns. Light demand turned out to be a much stronger predictor of tree architecture than Hmax, probably because of the relatively low, open, and semi-evergreen canopy at the research site. The existence of four functional groups (shade-tolerant, partial-shade-tolerant, and long- and short-lived pioneer) was confirmed by the principal component and discriminant analysis: Both light demand and H-max capture the major variation in functional traits found among tropical rain forest tree species, and the two-way classification scheme provides a straightforward model to understand niche differentiation in tropical forests.},

  abstract = {We present a new 23-site network of white spruce ring-width chronologies near boreal treeline in Old Crow Flats, Yukon Territory, Canada. Most chronologies span the last 300 years and some reach the mid-16th century. The chronologies exhibit coherent growth patterns before the 1930s. However, since the 1930s, they diverge in trend and exhibit one of two contrasting, but well-replicated patterns we call Group 1 and Group 2. Over the instrumental period (1930-2007) Group 1 sites were inversely correlated with previous-year July temperatures while Group 2 sites were positively correlated with growth-year June temperatures. At the broader northwestern North America (NWNA) scale, we find that the Group 1 and Group 2 patterns are common to a number of white spruce chronologies, which we call NWNA 1 and NWNA 2 chronologies. The NWNA 1 and NWNA 2 chronologies also share a single coherent growth pattern prior to their divergence (ca. 1950s). Comparison of the NWNA 1/NWNA 2 chronologies against gridded 20th-century temperatures for NWNA and reconstructed northern hemisphere summer temperatures (AD 1300-2000) indicates that all sites responded positively to temperature prior to the mid-20th century (at least back to AD 1300), but that some changed to a negative response (NWNA 1) while others maintained a positive response (NWNA 2). The spatial extent of divergence implies a large-scale forcing. As the divergence appears to be restricted to the 20th century, we suggest that the temperature response shift represents a moisture stress caused by an anomalously warm, dry 20th-century climate in NWNA, as indicated by paleoclimatic records. However, because some sites do not diverge and are located within a few kilometres of divergent sites, we speculate that site-level factors have been important in determining the susceptibility of sites to the large-scale drivers of divergence.},

This involves two nearest-neighbour methods for the identification of stand structures, i.e., the aggregation index R by Clark and Evans [Clark, Ph.J. and Evans, F.C., 1954. Distance to nearest neighbor as a measure of spatial relationships in populations. Ecology 35 (4) 445–453.] for univariate patterns and the segregation index S by Pielou [Pielou, E.C., 1977. Mathematical Ecology. Wiley.] for bivariate patterns. Both were used to describe the structure of 53 experimental plots of mixed beech-larch stands in Lower Saxony which provided the data base for this investigation. The second part of the study deals with the development of the STRUGEN stand structure generator, designed for the modeling and reproduction of spatial stand structures. To generate stand structures, a two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson process is used as well as a set of two-dimensional distribution functions which determine mixture type and intermingling intensity of main and associated tree species. Moreover, a distance function secures minimum distances between competing neighbouring trees. Consequently, the produced pattern is the result of a combination of an inhomogeneous Poisson process (for generating mixture units) and a hard-core process (for securing minimum distances between neighbours). The STRUGEN generator was designed and successfully used for the investigation of 53 mixed beech-larch stands. It provides initial values and stand structures for distance-dependent single-tree models from estimated qualitative stand characteristics. STRUGEN is a useful tool and allows initial, pragmatic steps towards fully utilising available qualitative and quantitative information to diagnose the state of a forest and to predict its growth.},

  abstract = {On the basis of nine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and ten European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) thinning experiments in Germany, for which both residual and removed stock had been registered first during 1870, I scrutinize how moderate and heavy thinning from below (B-, C-grade) affects the production of merchantable volume compared with light thinning (A-grade). In relation to A-grade, cumulative merchantable volume (CV) of B- and C-grade amounts in average to 103-107% in juvenile and to 97-102% in mature Norway spruce stands. The corresponding findings for European beech are 101-106% and 94-102%. CV of individual stands varies between 89% and 130% for Norway spruce and 73% and 155% for European beech (CV of A-grade = 100%). These findings are substantiated by the relation between stand density (SDI) and periodic annual increment (PAI). On the B- and C-grade plots of spruce and beech, respectively, SDI was reduced down to 41-91% and 31-83% of the A-grade. When SDI is reduced in young stands, PAI follows a unimodal curve. Norway spruce's PAI culminates in 109% if SDI is reduced to 59%; European beech's PAI culminates in 123% when density is reduced to 50%. Whereas Norway spruce's growth reacts most positively on thinning under poor site conditions and with increment reduction on favourable sites, European beech behaves oppositely. With stand development the culmination point of the unimodal relation moves towards maximum density, so that in older stands PAI follows the increasing pattern, which is the left portion of a unimodal curve. A model is presented which apparently unifies contradictory patterns of stand density-growth reactions by integrating relative stand density, average tree size and site fertility effects, and makes the findings operable for forest management.},

Lowering of stand density down to 20% of the maximum Stand Density, Index affects size growth to such an extent, that tightly packed resp. sparsely stocked stands represent very different ontogenetic stadia of stand development. However, when density is reduced, total biomass production follows a unimodal optimum curve with a broad plateau. In the tightly packed stands growing area efficiency increases with increasing supply of growing space and achieves highest values. However in such stands small-sized trees are dominating and only very few tall trees exploit the high efficiency. Stand growth is reduced by the high number of small and relatively inefficient crowns. When size growth is accelerated by reduction of stem number, growing area efficiency decreases. However, the high number of mean-sized trees with mean efficiency result in a maximum of biomass increment on stand level. A further widening of the growing area causes a decrease of growing area efficiency and a right hand sided steepness of the size frequency distribution what results in reduction of biomass increment on stand level. The high elasticity of resource and biomass allocation in respect to density means resilience under natural and man-made disturbances and is interpreted as the result of selective pressure.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mixed-species forest stands are well explored in their favourable ecological, economical, and socio-economical functions and services compared with pure stands, but still poorly understood in their structure and functioning. Canopy structure and tree morphology affect the environmental conditions within the stand, the tree growth, and by this most forest functions and services. Here, I review how canopy structure and crown morphology in mixed stands can differ from pure stands and how this depends on the selection of tree species and interactions between them. The focus is on the macrostructure of canopy and crowns derived from the trees’ positions, their convex crown hulls, and their space filling with branches. In mixed canopies the sum of the crown projection area, but not the ground coverage by crowns, mostly exceeds pure stands due to multiple crown overlaps. The interspecific differences in crown shape and allometric scaling cause a ‘selection effect’ when complementary species are combined. In interspecific environment furthermore ‘true mixing effects’ like intraspecific shifts in size, shape, and inner space filling of crowns may occur. The much denser and more plastic canopy space filling in mixed stands may increase light interception, stand density, productivity, and growth resilience to disturbances. I discuss the relevance of interspecific interactions for forest management, model building, and theory development and draw perspectives of further research into stand canopy and crown structure.},

We re-evaluate this rule based on 28 fully stocked pure stands of common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and common oak (Quercus petraea [Mattuschka] Liebl.) in Germany that date back to the year 1870. OLS regression of the model In(N) = a + b (.) ln(d) results in b values of -1.789 for common beech, -1.664 for Norway spruce, -1.593 for Scots pine, and -1.424 for common oak. The allometric coefficient for common beech differs significantly from the other species. There is also a significant difference between the b values of Norway spruce and common oak. Except for Scots pine, the above allometric coefficients deviate significantly (common beech) and close-to-significantly (Norway spruce, common oak) from the coefficient -1.605 postulated by Reineke in 1933. To cover the species-specific oscillation of mortality rates, we additionally calculate the self-thinning coefficient for each survey period. Ecological implications of the species-specific scaling exponents are stressed and consequences regarding tools for regulating stand density are discussed.},

Stands still follow similar general allometric rules, but proceed more rapidly through usual trajectories. As forest stands develop faster, tree numbers are currently 17–20% lower than in past same-aged stands. Self-thinning lines remain constant, while growth rates increase indicating the stock of resources have not changed, while growth velocity and turnover have altered. Statistical analyses of the experimental plots, and application of an ecophysiological model, suggest that mainly the rise in temperature and extended growing seasons contribute to increased growth acceleration, particularly on fertile sites.},

Based on 14 observational plots, this study shows that tree size and stand parameters of oak (sessile oak, Quercus petraea (MATT.) LIEBL. and pedunculate oak, Quercus robur L.) presently develop much faster than in the past, which is highly relevant for forestry in Central Europe. Thus, certain threshold sizes are reached decades earlier compared with the past. Due to the accelerated stand development, stem numbers per unit area are presently lower than at the same stand age in the past, while at the same time, stand density is higher. As we can show, also the level of the tree growth rate vs. tree size allometry increased significantly. These changes have major consequences for forest ecology and management, forest modeling, and eco-monitoring.},

  abstract = {Against a backdrop of increasing climate change, the effects of site conditions, drought events and ozone stress on the size-growth relationship in Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]) stands are analyzed. The size-growth relationship is represented by a straight line defined by intercept and slope of a simple linear equation with stem diameter at height 1.30 m as independent variable and annual stem diameter increment at height 1.30 as dependent variable. On the basis of 64 long-term experimental plots dating back to 1871 and representing an ecological gradient from fertile to poor sites, it is shown that poorer sites exhibit shallower slopes of the linear size-growth relationships than fertile sites. Annual measurements of the size-growth relationship, including the extremely dry years of 1976 and 2003, also showed that lower stand growth rates result in shallower size-growth relationship slopes. By comparing stands with and without experimental twice-ambient ozone exposure between 2000 and 2007, it was found that ozone stress can significantly reduce the slope of the size-growth relationship. This indicates that limiting site condition, whether acute or chronic in nature, distinctly reduces the superiority of tall trees, and that a lower degree of resource limitation increases the steepness of the size-growth relationship. The causes for this behavior and the consequences for stand dynamics, silvicultural treatment and prognostication by models are discussed.},

  abstract = {Species mixing is widely held to stabilize productivity, increase resilience and contribute to risk minimization in forest stands in need of special as a result of longevity. However, research on the effects of mixing on productivity and resource consumption so far yielded fairly incoherent results rather than general findings. We focused on the effects of the spatial mixing pattern and the annual climate conditions on the mixing effect, which to date have seldom been considered as modifiers of mixing effects. Nine years of intensive survey of four pure stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]) and two mixed plots with different mixing pattern showed: (1) mixing hardly changed annual net primary productivity at stand level when Norway spruce and European beech are cultivated group-wise but increased by 37 % on account of a higher efficiency of water and light use in individual tree-wise mixture. (2) Favourable climatic conditions increased the superiority of mixed versus pure stands productivity, while, in particular, water stress cancelled the benefit of mixing considerably. (3) An interaction between the spatial pattern and variable climatic conditions was revealed. Both improved light and water use were found in favourable years in close inter-specific intermingling. However, in unfavourable years the spatial pattern played a less pronounced role in terms of productivity.},

  abstract = {Mixed-species forests can sometimes fulfil forest functions and services better than monocultures and are therefore receiving growing attention in forest science and practice. The productivity of mixtures and the interactions between species are influenced by the availability of different resources and climatic conditions, all of which change spatially and temporally. Models are a valuable tool for understanding and predicting how these interacting factors will influence the growth and other functions and services in mixed-species forests. However, concepts, models and theory are still mainly based on monocultures, which have dominated forest science since its beginnings. Recent empirical works report strong effects of mixing tree species on the environmental conditions within stands (e.g., vertical light profile, rooting space, humus layer), their functioning (e.g., photosynthetic rate, light use, growth), and tree and stand structure (e.g., crown and stem shape, shoot and root morphology). Process-based organ- or tree-level approaches reveal changed resource supply, flows and metabolic rates in high spatial and temporal resolution. Stand-level approaches usually provide predictions with a lower spatial and temporal resolution but can be more accurate in the longer-term. Many studies stress considerable effects of mixing tree species on growth dynamics, yield, resilience and stability, but these effects are still under-represented in existing models. We reviewed 54 forest growth models to show how they incorporate the variability of individual tree or species characteristics that occur in forests and how this variability influences the development and characteristics of the whole stand. While some organ- or tree-level models inherently integrate evident processes, stand-level models do not usually explicitly consider species interactions. Nevertheless, many processes that occur in mixtures can also be modelled at the stand level and are often included in stand-level monospecific models. Stand-level models are likely to offer a simpler alternative model structure for mixtures. We stress how both model approaches can be refined, benefit from mutual adjustment, and can be substantiated by further empirical research into mixed-species forests.},

  abstract = {Background Forest management in Europe is committed to sustainability. In the face of climate change and accompanying risks, however, planning in order to achieve this aim becomes increasingly challenging, underlining the need for new and innovative methods. Models potentially integrate a wide range of system knowledge and present scenarios of variables important for any management decision. In the past, however, model development has mainly focused on specific purposes whereas today we are increasingly aware of the need for the whole range of information that can be provided by models. It is therefore assumed helpful to review the various approaches that are available for specific tasks and to discuss how they can be used for future management strategies. Scope Here we develop a concept for the role of models in forest ecosystem management based on historical analyses. Five paradigms of forest management are identified: (1) multiple uses, (2) dominant use, (3) environmentally sensitive multiple uses, (4) full ecosystem approach and (5) eco-regional perspective. An overview of model approaches is given that is dedicated to this purpose and to developments of different kinds of approaches. It is discussed how these models can contribute to goal setting, decision support and development of guidelines for forestry operations. Furthermore, it is shown how scenario analysis, including stand and landscape visualization, can be used to depict alternatives, make long-term consequences of different options transparent, and ease participation of different stakeholder groups and education. Conslusions In our opinion, the current challenge of forest ecosystem management in Europe is to integrate system knowledge from different temporal and spatial scales and from various disciplines. For this purpose, using a set of models with different focus that can be selected from a kind of toolbox according to particular needs is more promising than developing one overarching model, covering ecological, production and landscape issues equally well.},

  abstract = {Mixing of complementary tree species may increase stand productivity, mitigate the effects of drought and other risks, and pave the way to forest production systems which may be more resource-use efficient and stable in the face of climate change. However, systematic empirical studies on mixing effects are still missing for many commercially important and widespread species combinations. Here we studied the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in mixed versus pure stands on 32 triplets located along a productivity gradient through Europe, reaching from Sweden to Bulgaria and from Spain to the Ukraine. Stand inventory and taking increment cores on the mainly 60–80 year-old trees and 0.02–1.55 ha sized, fully stocked plots provided insight how species mixing modifies the structure, dynamics and productivity compared with neighbouring pure stands. In mixture standing volume (+12 %), stand density (+20 %), basal area growth (+12 %), and stand volume growth (+8 %) were higher than the weighted mean of the neighbouring pure stands. Scots pine and European beech contributed rather equally to the overyielding and overdensity. In mixed stands mean diameter (+20 %) and height (+6 %) of Scots pine was ahead, while both diameter and height growth of European beech were behind (−8 %). The overyielding and overdensity were independent of the site index, the stand growth and yield, and climatic variables despite the wide variation in precipitation (520–1175 mm year−1), mean annual temperature (6–10.5 °C), and the drought index by de Martonne (28–61 mm °C−1) on the sites. Therefore, this species combination is potentially useful for increasing productivity across a wide range of site and climatic conditions. Given the significant overyielding of stand basal area growth but the absence of any relationship with site index and climatic variables, we hypothesize that the overyielding and overdensity results from several different types of interactions (light-, water-, and nutrient-related) that are all important in different circumstances. We discuss the relevance of the results for ecological theory and for the ongoing silvicultural transition from pure to mixed stands and their adaptation to climate change.},

  abstract = {While previous studies focused on tree growth in pure stands, we reveal that tree resistance and resilience to drought stress can be modified distinctly through species mixing. Our study is based on tree ring measurement on cores from increment boring of 559 trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) in South Germany, with half sampled in pure, respectively, mixed stands. Indices for resistance, recovery and resilience were applied for quantifying the tree growth reaction on the episodic drought stress in 1976 and 2003. The following general reaction patterns were found. (i) In pure stands, spruce has the lowest resistance, but the quickest recovery; oak and beech were more resistant, but recover was much slower and they are less resilient. (ii) In mixture, spruce and oak perform as in pure stands, but beech was significantly more resistant and resilient than in monoculture. (iii) Especially when mixed with oak, beech is facilitated. We hypothesise that the revealed water stress release of beech emerges in mixture because of the asynchronous stress reaction pattern of beech and oak and a facilitation of beech by hydraulic lift of water by oak. This facilitation of beech in mixture with oak means a contribution to the frequently reported overyield of beech in mixed versus pure stands. We discuss the far-reaching implications that these differences in stress response under intra- and inter-specific environments have for forest ecosystem dynamics and management under climate change.},

  abstract = {We assessed the effects of thinning (0, 20 and 30 % extraction of basal area) and canopy type (pine-beech vs. pine plots, beech accounting for 12 % of total basal area) on radial growth of dominant and codominant Scots pine at inter-annual scale and on microclimatic conditions, radial growth and xylogenesis 9 years after thinning at intra-annual scale. Thinning weakly affected pine growth, which was enhanced 3 years after harvesting. Over time, a gradual reduction in pine growth in mixed canopy relative to pure canopy occurred only in unthinned plots apparently due to beech expansion. Indeed, 9 years after thinning, a higher seasonal radial increment and a greater number of tracheids were produced under pine canopy in the unthinned plots, whereas no differences between canopy types were observed in the thinned plots. Radial increment and tracheid production were mainly affected by tree water status (air and soil humidity, throughfall). The differences of tree water status caused by treatments, and plausibly disparities in tree size and tree-to-tree competition, were the main drivers explaining the patterns observed for radial increment and xylogenesis. Our results suggest that the negative effects of beech competition on Scots pine growth in similar mixed forest may be controlled to some extent by thinning.},

  abstract = {A major challenge for foresters in the future will be issues related to global change. Global change expresses itself in a variety of ways, depending on regional vegetation and climate patterns, small-scale topographic differences, tree species, and stand development stages. Using silviculture as an example, the variety of steps linking global chcinge-as a general concept-and actual management decisions is explored. The first task is to relate global change aspects to silviculturally relevant scales. Second, silvicultural responses must reflect the wide variety of changes, including their interactions. A number of management recommendations hove been proposed from the global scale to the application of specific silviculturel treatments. These recommendations are mostly focused on increasing the resistance of forests to perturbations. Increasing ecosystem adaptability and resilience through silviculturel practices may benefit from developments in other scientific fields. Recent advances in the complexity and ecosystem sciences may provide approaches that are better suited for a future with increased variability and uncertainty in ecological and social conditions. Specifically, managing forests as complex adaptive systems may provide a conceptual framework that can be useful for silviculture, even though much work still must be done to fully expiate the implications of such a new framework for silvicultural decisionmaking.},

On each site, four different treatments were applied, including a control treatment and short-, medium, and long-term regeneration periods aimed at the complete removal of overstory trees within 20, 35, and 50 years, respectively. These treatments created a wide variety of growing conditions for individual trees. Relationships between relative diameter growth and stand-level and neighborhood interaction indices were evaluated. Growing conditions for individual trees in control conditions were best characterized using Lorimer's index for a 16 m radius neighborhood. Equations predicting tree growth in control stands underpredicted initial growth of trees after harvesting operations, suggesting a release effect that is not captured by postharvest density. This effect was larger for smaller trees and influenced by removal intensity. Growth response to density reductions was also influenced by previous harvests. Our results suggest that the growth response of mature trees to reproduction harvests may become an important consideration when increased emphasis is placed on managing for long-term regeneration periods.},

  abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term (<= 15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (H-20, height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (Z*, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing Z* showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (h) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum).},

Seasonal courses of leaf water potential were similar for both species, whereas mean net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were always higher in sessile oak than in beech. The relationship between net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance was strong for both species. Sessile oak had high rates of photosynthesis even under very low leaf water potentials and high air temperatures, whereas the photosynthetic rate of beech decreased at low water potentials. Diurnal patterns were similar in both species but sessile oak had higher rates of CO2 assimilation than beech. Our results indicate that sessile oak is more tolerant of drought than beech, due, in part, to its maintenance of photosynthesis at low water potential.},

  abstract = {Understanding long-term changes in forest ecosystem carbon stocks under forest management practices such as timber harvesting is important for assessing the contribution of forests to the global carbon cycle. Harvesting effects are complicated by the amount, type, and condition of residue left on-site, the decomposition rate of this residue, the incorporation of residue into soil organic matter and the rate of new detritus input to the forest floor from regrowing vegetation. In an attempt to address these complexities, the forest succession model LINKAGES was used to assess the production of aboveground biomass, detritus, and soil carbon stocks in native Eucalyptus forests as influenced by five harvest management practices in New South Wales, Australia. The original decomposition sub-routines of LINKAGES were modified by adding components of the Rothamsted (RothC) soil organic matter turnover model. Simulation results using the new model were compared to data from long-term forest inventory plots. Good agreement was observed between simulated and measured above-ground biomass, but mixed results were obtained for basal area. Harvesting operations examined included removing trees for quota sawlogs (QSL, DBH &gt;80 cm), integrated sawlogs (ISL, DBH &gt;20 cm) and whole-tree harvesting in integrated sawlogs (WTH). We also examined the impact of different cutting cycles (20, 50 or 80 years) and intensities (removing 20, 50 or 80 m3). Generally medium and high intensities of shorter cutting cycles in sawlog harvesting systems produced considerably higher soil carbon values compared to no harvesting. On average, soil carbon was 2–9% lower in whole-tree harvest simulations whereas in sawlog harvest simulations soil carbon was 5–17% higher than in no harvesting.},

Current annual and seasonal budgets were calculated and budgets for three theoretical rotation lengths were simulated. Results showed that current budgets were negative for most elements in the young stand, but that the deficit decreased with stand age. The budgets were balanced or positive in the older stand. Element deficits in the young stand were related to biomass accumulation and to considerable losses in seepage waters. High nitrification levels related to past land uses were responsible for leaching losses of nitrates and cations. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen was an additional constraint in this N-saturated ecosystem. Simulated element budgets showed that whole tree harvesting should not be prescribed in these stands. Even when stem-only harvesting was practised, the balancing of the nutrient budgets would require a rotation length between 100 and 120 years, which is both technically and economically unrealistic. Sustainable management of such high production Douglas-fir forests would require nutrient inputs from fertilisation to maintain soil quality and their capacity to produce biomass at high rates.},

  abstract = {1. The empirical study of forest ecosystem dynamics is difficult because of the longevity of trees. Many types of models were developed to assist with this problem, all of them with advantages and disadvantages. The strengths of gap models are that they are able to simulate forest dynamics under changing climatic conditions and are therefore suitable for exploring future forest dynamics. 2. Most temperate and boreal forests are managed, making it important to incorporate harvesting functions depicting a wide range of silvicultural practices into the models and to test them under different climatic conditions. This is a necessary prerequisite to the application of these models under climatic change scenarios. Most gap models, however, do not feature such submodels, which disqualifies them as decision support tools. 3. We implemented a management submodel in the gap model FORCLIM that is able to simulate a wide range of cutting and thinning techniques, including continuous cover forestry ('plentering'). We tested the new submodel against long-term data (72-111 years) from eight growth and yield research plots across climatic conditions ranging from warm-dry to cold-wet. 4. Stem numbers were simulated accurately in nearly all cases, basal area showed a good fit on Quercus-dominated plots, but an over/underestimation on Fagus sylvatica-dominated and Picea abies-dominated plots. The diameter distributions simulated for the time of the most recent inventory did not differ significantly from empirical data except for two cases. Harvested basal area and stem numbers mostly agreed well with empirical data, but showed the same deviation from reality as simulated basal area. 5. Simulations run with an accurate management plan taken from foresters' reports for the plots yielded nearly the same results as those run with a generic management setting. 6. Synthesis and applications. We have demonstrated that (i) the management submodel adequately depicts silvicultural treatments, including continuous cover forestry; (ii) a generic harvesting setting can be substituted for a very detailed one, thus eliminating a major source of uncertainty in assessments of future forest dynamics; and (iii) as the new version of FORCLIM is able to deal with widely differing current climates, it can be employed with reasonable confidence to simulate future management strategies under climatic change. Overall, this modelling work is a major step towards the use of succession models as decision support tools in forest management.},

  abstract = {The potential effects of global changes on forests are of increasing concern. Dendrochronology, which deals with long-term records of tree growth under natural environmental conditions, can be used to evaluate the impact of climatic change on forest productivity. However, assessment of climatic change impacts must be supported by accurate and reliable models of the relationships between climate and tree growth. In this study, a bioclimatic model is used to explore the relationships between tree radial growth and bioclimatic variables closely related to the biological functioning of a tree. This model is at an intermediate level of complexity between purely empirical and process-based models. The method is illustrated with data for 21 Aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis Mill.) stands grown under a Mediterranean climate in south-east France. The results show that Aleppo pine growth is mainly controlled by soil water availability during the growing season. The bioclimatic variable which best expresses the observed inter-annual tree growth variations is the actual evapotranspiration (AET). Four parameters were adjusted to simulate dendrochronological data: the soil water capacity, the wilting point, the minimum temperature for photosynthesis, and the end of the growing season. The bioclimatic model gives better results than the standard response function and provides better insight into the functional processes involved in tree growth. The convincing results obtained by the bioclimatic model as well as the limited numbers of parameters it requires demonstrate the feasibility of using it to explore future climatic change impacts on Aleppo pine forests..},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Our knowledge about the influences of environmental factors on tree growth is principally based on the study of dominant trees. However, tree social status may influence intra-annual dynamics of growth, leading to differential responses to environmental conditions. The aim was to determine whether within-stand differences in stem diameters of trees belonging to different crown classes resulted from variations in the length of the growing period or in the rate of cell production. Methods Cambial activity was monitored weekly in 2006 for three crown classes in a 40-year-old silver-fir (Abies alba) plantation near Nancy (France). Timings, duration and rate of tracheid production were assessed from anatomical observations of the developing xylem. Key Results Cambial activity started earlier, stopped later and lasted longer in dominant trees than in intermediate and suppressed ones. The onset of cambial activity was estimated to have taken 3 weeks to spread to 90% of the trees in the stand, while the cessation needed 6 weeks. Cambial activity was more intense in dominant trees than in intermediate and suppressed ones. It was estimated that about 75% of tree-ring width variability was attributable to the rate of cell production and only 25% to its duration. Moreover, growth duration was correlated to tree height, while growth rate was better correlated to crown area. Conclusions These results show that, in a closed conifer forest, stem diameter variations resulted principally from differences in the rate of xylem cell production rather than in its duration. Tree size interacts with environmental factors to control the timings, duration and rate of cambial activity through functional processes involving source-sink relationships principally, but also hormonal controls.},

  abstract = {The scientific evidence for climate change caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases into the earth's atmosphere is increasing. A new set of modelled climate projections for Ireland has been downscaled in a regional climate model (RCM) and tested by the Community Climate Change Consortium for Ireland (C4I). The RCM climate simulations provide more detail on the likely changes in Ireland's climate throughout this century. In this paper we examine projections from the medium high (A2) scenario in relation to climatic indices important for forestry, and discuss the impacts and evaluate adaptation options for species choice and forest management. The change in Ireland's climate in terms of warmth and climatic droughtiness, which are both important for tree growth and survival, has been predicted from C4I data. The spatial and temporal changes in the mean climate indicate increasing warmth and droughtiness in the south and east of Ireland. The decadal frequency of extreme climatic events will increase. Drought frequency is predicted to increase to 3-4 droughts per decade over large parts of central and southern Ireland by 2050, increasing to more than 7 droughts per decade towards the end of the century. Drought sensitive species such as Sitka spruce and beech are very likely to become less well suited on certain site types in the south and east of Ireland. Irish forestry must therefore adapt to climate change. This involves making changes to species, provenance selection, and silviculture. Decision support tools are urgently required to guide strategic policy, for example to guide woodland grant incentives to maintain a robust and sustainable forest policy response to climate change. Tools are also required to support the operational response, for example to identify potential site and climate related problems, and to identify well-adapted species, provenance and silvicultural systems. Current work within the CLIMIT programme will provide these tools in the COFORD-funded project CLIMADAPT.},

We compared below-canopy and open-field data for minimum, maximum and daily mean temperature, relative humidity, maximum and daily mean photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed from 1998 to 2007. We found clear differences between below-canopy and open-field temperatures, humidity, wind speed and PAR and could relate them to the specific site conditions and forest type. The forest influence on PAR and maximum temperature is clearly determined by the forest type, whereas the influence on minimum temperature is affected by both forest type and slope orientation and impact on humidity depends on the soil type. The wind speed is most impacted by topography and slope orientation.},

  abstract = {Background: Below-ground competition as a major structuring force in plant communities can be either symmetric or asymmetric with important consequences for the coexistence of plants. It is a matter of controversy whether asymmetry in competition increases with resource availability or not. Aims: This study tested the hypotheses that root competition between mature Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea trees is asymmetric and that asymmetry is more pronounced in non-water-limited environments. Methods: Initially equal-sized tree fine roots were grown for 365-390 days in root growth chambers in situ and exposed to competition by either a conspecific or an allospecific root. Relative root growth rate was used to determine asymmetry in root competition. Different soil moisture regimes were considered by conducting a throughfall reduction experiment and by including data from earlier experiments with contrasting moisture regimes. Results: The competitive interaction between Fagus and Quercus fine roots is asymmetric; root morphology appears to depend on the presence of a competitor; and asymmetry in root competition increases with increasing soil moisture availability. Conclusions: Below-ground competition in temperate broad-leaved mixed forests can be as asymmetric as competition for light, with asymmetry decreasing with increasing water shortage.},

It consists in a nonparametric version of discriminant analysis by replacing linear regression by any nonparametric regression method. A new option for FDA, consisting in a nonparametric regression method based on B-spline functions, will be introduced. The relevance of the transformation (hence the discrimination) depends on the parameters defining the spline functions: degree, number and location of the knots for each continuous variable. This method called FDA-FKBS (Free Knot B-Splines) allows to determine all these parameters without the necessity of many prior parameters.

Specific objectives were to (1) evaluate performance of the Forest Vegetation Simulator Northeast Variant (FVS-NE) equations, (2) explore suitable model forms and compare the influence of various tree- and stand-level variables on HT prediction and (3) develop species-specific equations that are unbiased across a broad geographic region. Data were available from an extensive database covering Maine, three provinces of the Canadian Maritimes and southern Québec. The study showed that the widely used FVS-NE model had significant prediction biases for all species in the region. The best model form among those evaluated was the von Bertalanffy–Richards (vB-R; commonly referred to as the Chapman–Richards), with added covariates that included crown competition factor, basal area in trees larger than subject tree and a climate-derived site index.},

Data were analysed collectively considering several factors (trial, block, plot and period) as random effects. Total volume and volume increment decreased with thinning intensity, this loss being more significant in the case of moderate and heavy thinning. No difference was found among treatments for total basal area or the increment in basal area. The results revealed an optimum basal area (Assmann's definition) between 85 and 100% of the basal area in unthinned plots. Volume growth loss associated with heavy thinnings (reduction of 18% in volume increment) was smaller than that reported in Central and Northern European regions (greater than 25%). Height increment was not influenced by thinning, whereas dominant and quadratic mean diameter increments increased with the thinning intensity. The response of diameter growth to thinning was greater at younger ages (less than 50 y) and in medium-sized trees.},

  abstract = {In Mediterranean forestry, it is important to improve knowledge about mixed stands dynamics, including their productivity. Previous studies have focused on the interactions between different species (competition, reduction of competition and facilitation) depending on site, species composition and structure. At the centre of this research arc the possible differences between pure and mixed stands of Pinus sylvestris and Quercus pyrenaica in terms of density-growth relationships and volume growth per species. Using data from the second and third Spanish National Forest Inventory (606 plots), volume increment models for these species were fitted. Both species displayed a similar density-growth pattern for pure and mixed stands, with a maximum volume growth at maximum density. Volume increment per occupied area was also found to be greater in mixed stands as opposed to pure stands, suggesting a species interaction with reduced levels of competition in the former. However, the total volume growth was generally lower in mixed stands since the growth rate of oak is much lower. The results highlight the expedience of favouring P. sylvestris-Q. pyrenaica mixed stands with higher proportions of pine trees in order to gain the benefits of a more complex forest whilst retaining an acceptable level of wood production.},

  abstract = {Introduction The self-thinning relationship established by Reineke in 1933 assumes a relationship between the number of stems and the quadratic mean diameter in fully stocked pure stands. This rule is extensively used for management purposes, but it has been initially calibrated for pure, even-aged stands for relatively few species. Objectives Here, we extend this relationship to mixed-species and mixed-size forests through a generalized modeling approach. Reineke's rule can be seen as a particular case of this generalized approach. Resource sharing is taken as a starting point; thus, both site fertility and diameter heterogeneity are taken into account. Discussion Calibration on actual inventories is made on a dataset of 82 French stands. The theoretical relationship is successfully adjusted for species in which enough data were available, namely, common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), oak (Quercus petraea [Mattuschka] Liebl and Quercus robur L.), and Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst). Conclusion Self-thinning exponents obtained for beech and oak (1.86 and 1.76, respectively) can be used in the mixed-species equation that we developed. These results encourage calibrating the parameters for other species if appropriate data are available.},

  abstract = {Model validation is often realized as a test of how well model predictions match a set of independent observations. One would think that the burden of proof should rest with the model, to force it to show that it can make accurate predictions. Further, one would think that increasing the sample size ought to increase the model's ability to demonstrate its utility. Traditional statistical tools are inappropriate for this because they default to the case that the model and the data are no different, and their ability to detect differences increases with the sample size. These traditional tools are optimized to detect differences, rather than similarities. We present an alternative strategy for model validation that is based on regression and statistical tests of equivalence. Equivalence tests reverse the usual null hypothesis: they posit that the populations being compared are different and use the data to prove otherwise. In this sense, equivalence tests are lumping tests, whereas the traditional statistical tests are splitting tests. To date, model validation with equivalence tests has focused on comparisons of means. Our proposed test checks not only for similarity of means, but also for similarity between individual predictions and observations. The strategy is demonstrated using three case studies that differ in their modeling objectives, and for varied sample sizes. The proposed strategy provides a formal means of model validation that is superior to traditional statistical tests in each case.},

  abstract = {We describe and test Forest 5, an individual-tree growth and dynamics model for the Great Lakes region. Forest 5 includes reasonably detailed descriptions of physiology, soil and climate, and incorporates both empirically- and physiologically-based modules from Crobas, Linkages, Forest, Sortie, PnET, 3-PG, and other sources. We have evaluated a nonspatial variant of Forest 5 as a scientific statement of knowledge by comparing simulation results to a battery of ecosystem-level expectations. We also evaluated the same model as a tool for management by comparing single-species, single-age simulations against mensurational and ecological expectations. We finally compared multiple-species multi-age simulations against six measurements of permanent sample plots, spanning approximately 30 years, from a database from the University of Minnesota Cloquet Forestry Center. Here we describe Forest 5 in detail, introduce, explain, and apply the diagnostics, and interpret their results in the light of the model structure and goals. The model was judged defensible under certain circumstances but exhibited shortcomings that are probably due to nutrient cycling and the simulation of tree shape, crown shape, and competition. These shortcomings are in turn instructive in considering refinements to Forest 5 and possibly other models.},

  abstract = {Model validation that is based on statistical inference seeks to construct a statistical comparison of model predictions against measurements of the target process. Previously, such validation has commonly used the hypothesis of no difference as the null hypothesis, that is, the null hypothesis is that the model is acceptable. This is unsatisfactory, because using this approach tests are more likely to validate a model if they have low power. Here we suggest the usage of tests of equivalence, which use the hypothesis of dissimilarity as the null hypothesis, that is, the null hypothesis is that the model is unacceptable. Thus, they flip the burden of proof back onto the model. We demonstrate the application of equivalence testing to model validation using an empirical forest growth model and an extensive database of field measurements. Finally we provide some simple power analyses to guide future model validation exercises.},

  volume =   {360},
  pages =    {159-169},
  abstract = {Tree growth is strongly influenced, among other factors, by climate. Much knowledge regarding climate–growth relationships has been gained by studying tree rings. However, sufficient tree-ring data is rarely available if climate effects are required to be representative for large spatial scales, for example, in order to be used in scenario models to estimate forest development under climate change. Alternative data sources include large-scale forest inventories, although these usually provide lower temporal resolutions than tree rings. When working with temporally sparsely-resolved growth data, the question of how climate–growth relationships aggregate over time becomes relevant. To overcome this trade-off between spatial representativeness and temporal resolution, this study aims at optimally using the information contained in the annual resolution of tree rings to derive recommendations regarding the choice of climate variables for modeling tree growth based on forest inventories. We evaluated for Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica, which part of the year (spring, summer, vegetation period, whole year) and whether mean or extreme climatic conditions within inventory intervals should be taken into consideration. A three-step approach was used: (1) we used response functions to quantify the effect of monthly precipitation and temperature on annual basal area increments, (2) we temporally aggregated the annual basal area increments to hypothetical intervals of five and ten years, and correlated them with climate means and extremes – from different parts of the year – within the aggregated intervals, and (3) we fitted linear mixed-effects models to simultaneously quantify the effects of the climate variables, site characteristics and the years of the hypothetical inventories. The results did not generally differ between both species. Variables based on conditions during the whole year and partly during spring performed better than variables based on conditions during summer or the vegetation period. Defining the year as the period between October of the previous year and September of the current year allows possible lag effects of previous autumn and winter conditions to be taken into consideration. Mean climatic conditions reached or exceeded the correlations of the extremes and mostly performed similar to or better than the extremes in the models. Our results indicate that these relationships are insensitive to the often arbitrarily determined years, in which inventories take place. These findings can serve as basic recommendations for the choice of climate variables when modeling climate effects on multi-year growth of P. abies and F. sylvatica in the European lowlands.},

We offer a generalized method for deriving whole-stand survival models that are capable of modeling complex underlying hazard functions. We use our knowledge of the empirical hazard function to limit our selection to appropriate functions. Integrating selected functions results in initial condition difference equations that, when fitted to our data, provide biologically reasonable whole-stand survival predictions and adequately represent the underlying hazard function. Our method is relatively easy to implement and can model a whole-stand survival curve with a complex underlying hazard function. FOR. SCI. 50(5):686&#8211;695.},

  abstract = {Temperature is the most important factor affecting growth at high altitudes. As trees use much of the allocated carbon gained from photosynthesis to produce branches and stems, information on the timing and dynamics of secondary wood growth is crucial to assessing temperature thresholds for xylogenesis. We have carried out histological analyses to determine cambial activity and xylem cell differentiation in conifers growing at the treeline on the eastern Alps in two sites during 2002-2004 with the aim of linking the growth process with temperature and, consequently, of defining thresholds for xylogenesis. Cambial activity occurred from May to July-August and cell differentiation from May-June to September-October. The earliest start of radial enlargement was observed in stone pine in mid-May, while Norway spruce was the last species to begin tracheid differentiation. The duration of wood formation varied from 90 to 137 days, depending on year and site, with no difference between species. Longer durations were observed in trees on the south-facing site because of the earlier onset and later ending of cell production and differentiation. The threshold temperatures at which xylogenesis had a 0.5 probability of being active were calculated by logistic regressions. Xylogenesis was active when the mean daily air temperature was 5.6-8.5 degrees C and mean stem temperature was 7.2-9 degrees C. The similar thresholds among all trees suggested the existence of thermal limits in wood formation that correspond with temperatures of 6-8 degrees C that are supposed to limit growth at the treeline. Different soil temperature thresholds between sites indicated that soil temperature may not be the main factor limiting xylogenesis. This study represents the first attempt to define a threshold through comparative assessment of xylem growth and tissue temperatures in stem meristems at high altitudes.},

  abstract = {Aim To identify temperatures at which cell division and differentiation are active in order to verify the existence of a common critical temperature determining growth in conifers of cold climates. Location Ten European and Canadian sites at different latitudes and altitudes. Methods The periods of cambial activity and cell differentiation were assessed on a weekly time-scale on histological sections of cambium and wood tissue collected over 2 to 5 years per site from 1998 to 2005 from the stems of seven conifer species. All data were compared with daily air temperatures recorded from weather stations located close to the sites. Logistic regressions were used to calculate the probability of xylogenesis and of cambium being active at a given temperature. Results Xylogenesis lasted from May to October, with a growing period varying from 3 to 5 months depending on location and elevation. Despite the wide geographical range of the monitored sites, temperatures for onset and ending of xylogenesis converged towards narrow ranges with average values around 4-5, 8-9 and 13-14 degrees C for daily minimum, mean and maximum temperature, respectively. On the contrary, cell division in the cambium stopped in July-August, when temperatures were still high. Main conclusions Wood formation in conifers occurred when specific critical temperatures were reached. Although the timing and duration of xylogenesis varied among species, sites and years, the estimated temperatures were stable for all trees studied. These results provide biologically based evidence that temperature is a critical factor limiting production and differentiation of xylem cells in cold climates. Although daily temperatures below 4-5 degrees C are still favourable for photosynthesis, thermal conditions below these values could inhibit the allocation of assimilated carbon to structural investment, i.e. xylem growth.},

Growth distribution patterns of forests, empirically revealed and modeled on stand level, still lack of a causal explanation. Therefore, a physiological individual tree growth model was applied in order to explain recently published general growth distribution patterns. Our study focuses on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. KARST) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). This way, simulation results of the physiologically based growth model were compared to empirically found principles of resource allocation. The results of the scenario analyses suggest that the degree of size-symmetry increases with the trees' limiting factors, light and water. Size-symmetric competition and growth was found on poor sites whilst size-asymmetric behavior is dominant on more fertile sites. Synergies made by combining empirical research and model based hypothesis testing are discussed. The study also reflects that the use of physiologically based growth models can contribute to a better understanding of stand dynamics. Consequently, biological causalities based on the analysis of model simulations can support empirical findings.},

  abstract = {Height growth of 12 Douglas fir seed sources has been compared using modelling (height-age curves) and multifactorial analysis. Modelling led to the definition of significantly different seed source groups based on height growth rate (table V). The multifactorial analysis showed that seed sources had different growth patterns (figs 6, 7), linked to genotypic and environmental effects. For example, the 1976 drought slowed down the growth of some but not all seed sources (figs 4, 5). Age-age correlations for height have been investigated (figs 2, 3). The seed sources growth speed and pattern are useful in choosing the seed sources best adapted to different sylviculture type, and in particular, couple spacing-rotation. Respective advantages of multifactorial analysis and modelling have been discussed.},

  abstract = {Whereas the "law of the minimum" (LM) states that plant growth is limited by a single resource at any one time, the "multiple limitation hypothesis" (MLH) proposes that Optimum plant behavior results from balancing resource costs and benefits so that all resources limit plant growth simultaneously. We tested the hypothesis that neither the LM nor the MLH account for plant responses to all mineral nutrients. Fronds of the aquatic plant Lemna minor were grown in nutrient solutions with increasing levels of four nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. Neither LM or MLH adequately predicted plant responses to all of these nutrients: 23 of the 60 responses analyzed were classified as belonging to the LM; 20 cases were classified as undefined; and 17 cases as MLH. The type of response strongly depended on the specific pair of nutrients considered. The validity of the MLH model would depend on the accompanying resource limiting plant growth and on the severity of the stress. We propose that a "nutrient-specific" analysis, considering the biology of each mineral nutrient rather than grouping plant resources as a whole, is more appropriate than general models in understanding plant responses to nutrient availability.},

Understanding how tree mortality is driven by simultaneous drivers is needed to evaluate potential effects of climate change on forest composition. Using repeat-measure information from <italic>c.</italic> 400,000 trees from the Spanish Forest Inventory, we quantified the relative importance of tree size, competition, climate and edaphic conditions on tree mortality of 11 species, and explored the combined effect of climate and competition. Tree mortality was affected by all of these multiple drivers, especially tree size and asymmetric competition, and strong interactions between climate and competition were found. All species showed L-shaped mortality patterns (i.e. showed decreasing mortality with tree size), but pines were more sensitive to asymmetric competition than broadleaved species. Among climatic variables, the negative effect of temperature on tree mortality was much larger than the effect of precipitation. Moreover, the effect of climate (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation) on tree mortality was aggravated at high competition levels for all species, but especially for broadleaved species. The significant interaction between climate and competition on tree mortality indicated that global change in Mediterranean regions, causing hotter and drier conditions and denser stands, could lead to profound effects on forest structure and composition. Therefore, to evaluate the potential effects of climatic change on tree mortality, forest structure must be considered, since two systems of similar composition but different structure could radically differ in their response to climatic conditions.</p>},

  abstract = {Tree basal area (ba) or diameter at breast height (dbh) are universally used to represent tree secondary growth in individual tree based growth models. However, the long-term implications of using either ba or dbh for predictions are rarely fully assessed. In this analysis, Delta ba and Delta dbh increment equations were fit to identical datasets gathered from six conifer and four hardwood species grown in central Maine. The performance of Delta ba and Delta dbh predictions from nonlinear mixed-effects models were then compared with observed growth measurements of up to 29 years via a Monte Carlo simulation. Two evaluation statistics indicated substantial improvement in forecasting dbh using Delta dbh rather than Delta ba. Root mean squared error (RMSE) and percentage mean absolute deviation (MAD%) were reduced by 14% and 15% on average, respectively, across all projection length intervals (5-29 years) when Delta dbh was used over Delta ba. Differences were especially noted as projection lengths increased. RMSE and MAD% were reduced by 24% when Delta dbh was employed over Delta ba at longer projection lengths (up to 29 years). Simulations found that simulating random effects rather than using local estimates for random effects performed as well or better at longer interval lengths. These results highlight the implications that selecting a growth model dependent variable can have and the importance of incorporating model uncertainty into the growth projections of individual tree based models.},

This network has now reached one full rotation for the ten eucalypt sites in Australia, Brazil, China, Congo, India and South Africa. This paper reports an overall synthesis of tree and stand growth. Using a growth and yield modelling approach, we investigated the effects of slash management on site index defined as the asymptotic dominant height, basal area growth and stand structure. There were significant effects of slash and litter management treatments on two processes that drive tree and stand growth: site index and ability of trees to capture the site potential. These impacts were strongly site dependent. As expected, the soil organic carbon concentration could not be used alone to predict the intensity of stand response. Conversely, a ratio between nitrogen content in slash and litter prior to planting and the nitrogen concentration within the 0-10 cm soil layer, was a good predictor of the differences in stand productivity across treatments.},

The model predicts growth for all tree sizes continuously, rather than requiring a transition between independent models for juvenile and mature growth phases. The model predicts the effects of overstory and understory vegetative competition on height growth. Our model requires attained height rather than tree age as a predictor variable, thereby avoiding the problems of site index. Site effects are introduced as a function of ecological habitat type, elevation, aspect, and slope. We used six data sets totaling 3,785 trees in 314 plots. The structure of the data and the model indicated the need for a mixed-effects, nonlinear modeling approach using maximum likelihood in a linear differential equation with a power transformation. Behavior of the model was analyzed using a state-space approach. Our results show that both overstory and understory density affect height growth, allowing a manager to make informed decisions about vegetation control.},

Objectives This study aims to identify the climate variables that explain most of the variation in Pinus cembra radial growth at different spatial-temporal scales, response functions and moving response functions were processed on chronologies from a dense tree ring network. This original network is centred on the French Alps influenced by the Atlantic, Continental, and Mediterranean synoptic systems. Results A spatial clustering pattern matching the latitudinal climatic gradient was observed in tree ring indexed chronologies and climate responses. The stationary response functions computed for each cluster-averaged population evidenced a thermo-dependent northern cluster (Cl1), a rainfall-dependent southern cluster (Cl3), and an alternative response for the intermediate cluster in between (Cl2). Since the late nineteenth century, the moving response functions indicate an increasing influence of winter precipitation for the northern and the intermediate clusters. Conclusion Considering the increase in temperature and reduction both of summer precipitation predicted by general circulation models and of the snow cover and duration in the French Alps, stone pine is likely to be exposed to stressful conditions during the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Occasionally, surprisingly large shifts occur in ecosystems. Theory suggests that such shifts can be attributed to alternative stable states. Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology. Here, we review emerging ways to link theory to observation, and conclude that although, field observations can provide hints of alternative stable states, experiments and models are essential for a good diagnosis.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate different silvicultural systems for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the Netherlands in terms of timber production and wind stability over a full rotation. This was done using the forest genetics, ecology, management and wind model (ForGEM-W), which combines a distant dependent tree growth simulator with a mechanical–empirical wind damage module. Six different silvicultural systems were evaluated: normal yield table management, free thinning from above in a monospecies and a mixed stand (50 per cent mixture of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)), uneven-aged system, no thinning regime with low initial stand density of Douglas-fir with and without admixture of beech. Silvicultural systems leading to low height–diameter (h/d) ratios were most successful in avoiding damage. Low h/d ratios were obtained in the system with low stand density and no thinning and in the uneven-aged system by systematically removing trees with the highest ratios during thinning. In particular, the uneven-aged system combined a high timber production with low risk. The use of Douglas-fir–beech mixtures changed the competition pressure on Douglas-fir, and thus the h/d ratio and the wind risk. Results from this study indicate that the current trend towards more nature-oriented management could lead to lower wind risks and even to an increase in overall productivity.},

  abstract = {Effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning have been mainly studied in experiments that artificially create gradients in grassland plant diversity. Woody species were largely excluded from these early experiments, despite the ecological and socioeconomic importance of forest ecosystems. We discuss conceptual aspects of mechanistically driven research on the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship in forests, including the comparison of scientific approaches like 'observational studies', 'removal experiments', and 'synthetic-assemblage experiments'. We give a short overview on the differences between herbaceous and forest ecosystems, focusing on canopy characteristics, and the possibilities for individual versus population-based investigations. We present detailed information about the first large-scale, multisite and long-term biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment with tree species of temperate forests (BIOTREE - BIOdiversity and ecosystem processes in experimental TREE stands). At three sites of differing geology and local climate, we planted 200,000 saplings on a total area of 70 ha. At two sites, diversity gradients were established by varying the number of tree species (BIOTREE-SPECIES). At a third site, only functional diversity at a constant level of tree species richness was manipulated by selecting mixtures that differ in the functional trait values of the corresponding species (BIOTREE-FD). Additional experimental treatments at the subplot level include silvicultural management options, the addition of subdominant species, and the reduction of genetic diversity. Response variables focus on productivity, biogeochemical cycles and carbon sequestration, and resource use complementarity. We explore the use of different measures of functional diversity for a posteriori classifications of functional richness and their use in the analysis of our tree diversity experiment. The experiment is thought to provide a long-term research platform for a variety of scientific questions related to forest biodiversity and ecosystem processes. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

  abstract = {Question: Is quantile regression an appropriate statistical approach to estimate the response of fen species to single environmental factors? Background: Data sets in vegetation field studies are often characterized by a large number of zeros and they are generally incomplete in respect to the factors which possibly influence plant species distribution. Thus, it is problematic to relate plant species abundance to single environmental factors by the ordinary least squares regression technique of the conditional mean. Location: Riparian herbaceous fen in central Jutland (Denmark). Methods: Semi-parametric quantile regression was used to estimate the response of 18 plant species to six environmental factors, 95% regression quantiles were chosen to reduce the impact of multiple unmeasured factors on the regression analyses. Results of 95% quantile regression and ordinary least squares regression were compared. Results: The standard regression of the conditional mean underestimated the rates of change of species cover due to the selected factor in comparison to 95% regression quantiles. The fitted response curves indicated a general broad tolerance of the studied fen species to different flooding durations but a narrower range concerning groundwater amplitude. The cover of all species was related to soil exchangeable phosphate and base-richness. A relationship between soil exchangeable potassium and species cover was only found for 11 species. Conclusion: Considering the characteristics of data sets in vegetation science, non-linear quantile regression is a useful method for gradient analyses.},

Changes in CO 2 assimilation were observed during stomatal responses to RH changes and seemed to be a consequence of rather than a controlling factor for stomatal closure. There was an aftereffect of low RH on CO 2 assimilation. Stomata also closed in response to dry air in isolated epidermes. At the cellular level, water potential gradients within the leaf caused epidermal cell turgor to be very sensitive to changes in RH. Stomata were triggered by epidermal turgor but had their own metabolic time constant and response of opening and closing. Besides a feedforward response of stomata to RH there seemed to be an additional feedforward reaction to soil drying. Evidence was presented for a direct response of stomata to dry soil for sunflowers and wheat.},

Investment in bark aids in above-ground survival while investment in carbohydrate storage aids in recovery through resprouting and is especially important following above-ground tissue loss. We investigated bark allocation and carbohydrate investment in eight common oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>) species of Sky Island mountain ranges in west Texas. We hypothesized that relative investment in bark and carbohydrates changes with tree age and with fire regime: We predicted delayed investment in bark (positive allometry) and early investment in carbohydrates (negative allometry) under lower frequency, high severity fire regimes found in wetter microclimates. Common oaks of the Texas Trans-Pecos region (<italic>Quercus emoryi</italic>, <italic>Q. gambelii</italic>, <italic>Q. gravesii</italic>, <italic>Q. grisea</italic>, <italic>Q. hypoleucoides</italic>, <italic>Q. muehlenbergii</italic>, and <italic>Q. pungens</italic>) were sampled in three mountain ranges with historically mixed fire regimes: the Chisos Mountains, the Davis Mountains and the Guadalupe Mountains. Bark thickness was measured on individuals representing the full span of sizes found. Carbohydrate concentration in taproots was measured after initial leaf flush. Bark thickness was compared to bole diameter and allometries were analyzed using major axis regression on log-transformed measurements. We found that bark allocation strategies varied among species that can co-occur but have different habitat preferences. Investment patterns in bark were related to soil moisture preference and drought tolerance and, by proxy, to expected fire regime. Dry site species had shallower allometries with allometric coefficients ranging from less than one (negative allometry) to near one (isometric investment). Wet site species, on the other hand, had larger allometric coefficients, indicating delayed investment to defense. Contrary to our expectation, root carbohydrate concentrations were similar across all species and sizes, suggesting that any differences in below ground storage are likely to be in total volume of storage tissue rather than in carbohydrate concentration.</p>},

  abstract = {When plants are competing, larger individuals often obtain a disproportionate share of the contested resources and suppress the growth of their smaller neighbors, a phenomenon called size-asymmetric competition. We review what is known about the mechanisms that give rise to and modify the degree of size asymmetry in competition among plants, and attempt to clarify some of the confusion in the literature on size asymmetry. We broadly distinguish between mechanisms determined primarily by characteristics of contested resource from those that are influenced by the growth and behavior of the plants themselves. To generate size asymmetric resource competition, a resource must be "pre-emptable." Because of its directionality, light is the primary, but perhaps not the only, example of a pre-emptable resource. The available data. suggest that competition for mineral nutrients is often size symmetric (i.e., contested resources are divided in proportion to competitor sizes), but the potential role of patchily and/or episodically supplied nutrients in causing size asymmetry is largely unexplored. Virtually nothing is known about the size symmetry of competition for water. Plasticity in morphology and physiology acts to reduce the degree of size asymmetry in competition. We argue that an allometric perspective on growth, allocation, resource uptake, and resource utilization can help us understand and quantify the mechanisms through which plants compete.},

  abstract = {Natural disturbances play a key role in ecosystem dynamics and are important factors for sustainable forest ecosystem management. Quantitative models are frequently employed to tackle the complexities associated with disturbance processes. Here we review the wide variety of approaches to modelling natural disturbances in forest ecosystems, addressing the full spectrum of disturbance modelling from single events to integrated disturbance regimes. We applied a general, process-based framework founded in disturbance ecology to analyze modelling approaches for drought, wind, forest fires, insect pests and ungulate browsing. Modelling approaches were reviewed by disturbance agent and mechanism, and a set of general disturbance modelling concepts was deduced. We found that although the number of disturbance modelling approaches emerging over the last 15 years has increased strongly, statistical concepts for descriptive modelling are still largely prevalent over mechanistic concepts for explanatory and predictive applications. Yet, considering the increasing importance of disturbances for forest dynamics and ecosystem stewardship under anthropogenic climate change, the latter concepts are crucial tool for understanding and coping with change in forest ecosystems. Current challenges for disturbance modelling in forest ecosystems are thus (i) to overcome remaining limits in process understanding, (ii) to further a mechanistic foundation in disturbance modelling, (iii) to integrate multiple disturbance processes in dynamic ecosystem models for decision support in forest management, and (iv) to bring together scaling capabilities across several levels of organization with a representation of system complexity that captures the emergent behaviour of disturbance regimes.

  abstract = {Sustaining forest ecosystem functions and services under climate change is a major challenge for forest management. While conceptual advances of adapting coupled social ecological systems to environmental changes have been made recently, good practice examples at the operational level still remain rare. The current study presents the development of adaptation options for 164 550 ha of commercial forests under the stewardship of the Austrian Federal Forests (AFF). We used a comprehensive vulnerability assessment as analysis framework, employing ecosystem modeling and multicriteria decision analysis in a participatory approach with forest planers of the AFF. An assessment of the vulnerability of multiple ecosystem goods and services under current management served as the starting point for the development of adaptation options. Measures found to successfully reduce vulnerability include the promotion of mixed stands of species well adapted to emerging environmental conditions, silvicultural techniques fostering complexity, and increased management intensity. Assessment results for a wide range of site and stand conditions, stand treatment programs, and future climate scenarios were used to condense robust recommendations for adapting the management guidelines currently used by AFF practitioners. Overall, our results highlight the importance of timely adaptation to sustain forest goods and services and document the respective potential of silvicultural measures.},

  abstract = {For the period 2003-2006, fructification of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) was recorded at the Kranzberg forest site in Southern Germany by employing a crane with access to the canopy of more than 266 trees. For each tree, stem diameter and growth parameters were assessed annually as well as biomass of cones and seeds, number of seeds per cone, and proportions of empty seeds for a total of 371 trees with cone crop. Genotypes at 19 enzyme coding gene loci of 110 trees were included in the study of correlations between morphological and genetic traits. Re-scaling the observed values for a virtual pure Norway spruce stand of 1 ha, cone biomass including winged seeds (oven-dried at 38 degrees C) varied between 706.8 kg/ha in 2006 (average value per tree was 3.6 kg) and values close to zero in 2005. Corresponding values for vegetative biomass increment of the coning trees in 2006 were 9,273.0 kg/ha and 10.8 kg/tree. A significant higher biomass investment was determined for dominant trees in terms of absolute cone mass as well as in terms of cone mass relative to vegetative biomass and fructification frequency. No trade-off effects in decreased vegetative biomass growth were found in the fructification year, compared to trees that did not grow cones. Although the dominant trees invested proportionally considerable biomass in cones, they showed no significant reduction in vegetative biomass growth. In the following year no decrease in vegetative growth was detected. Based on logistic regressions and homogeneity tests, respectively, significant genetic effect became evident with respect to the gene loci AAP-B and AAT-C concerning fructification probability in the year with maximum generative biomass investment. These and closely related loci also have been found to be indicative for growth and viability, respectively, in other species.},

  abstract = {Characteristic growth patterns of individual organs are, to a large extent, determined by genetic factors, but can also be affected by intra-plant competition for resources and by environmental conditions. The current study proposes a dynamical system for modelling this dual control for logistic-based growth. The state of the system is defined by two state variables: size (s), and developmental age (a). The intrinsic properties of the system are represented by the potential relative growth rate as a function of a. This formulation allows dissection of the external effects on the system dynamics into two components: one that changes the duration of growth without affecting the final size and one that affects the final size without much effect on the duration. The former component determines the relationship between a and time, while the latter determines the effect on the system trajectory, s(a). The presented dynamical system is simpler and has a wider range of potential applications than the system proposed by Thornley and France (2005) for modelling logistic growth under resource limitation. The current approach can be also useful in ecology and in comparative studies of different genotypes and their responses to environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Since the 2003 drought and heat wave, Douglas-fir dieback has been reported in France in trees older than 30 years. Consequently, it is questioned whether selected Douglas-fir provenances are suited to the frequent and severe drought events which are forecast due to climate change. Our objective was to contribute to the screening of variability in productivity and growth response to soil-water deficit of mature trees from provenances not currently used for plantation in France. We sampled 22 provenances, including coastal and interior Douglas-fir, covering a wide part of its natural distribution, from Oregon to California for coastal provenances and from British Columbia to New Mexico for interior provenances. These provenances were planted at the mid 1970s in two provenance trials located in the south-west area of France. Variability of productivity, of wood density, and of radial growth in response to drought episodes among provenances was quantified and related to soil-water deficit computed by daily water balance calculations. Whatever the provenance, annual radial growth is highly dependent on local soil-water deficit (Felines R (2) = 0.57, Le Treps R-2 = 0.49). Radial growth and wood properties exhibit large differences between provenances at 30 years old. Variability between provenances for all wood characteristics studied is mainly structured geographically. Coastal provenances perform best for productivity at 30 years old (619 cm(2) +/- 59), and exhibit a small growth reduction in 2004, the second successive year of drought (-10.7 % +/- 3.8). Surprisingly, the southern interior provenances from the driest environments in the natural range show a large growth reduction in 2004 (-30.5 % +/- 5.2). The provenances tested exhibited significant differences in growth performance and growth reduction induced by the soil-water deficit. The approach coupling retrospective analysis of radial growth on mature trees and water balance modelling is relevant for evaluating provenance adaptation to more frequent or severe drought episodes.},

  abstract = {Since the 2003 drought and heat wave, there have been many reports of Douglas-fir decline and dieback in France. Given the climate change that is predicted, more frequent drought episodes could induce recurrent decline processes. The nature and background of this threat requires a careful assessment. The objectives of this study were: (1) to test the hypothesis that the major climate hazard that accounts for the decline in Douglas-fir growth is drought, and (2) to identify the main vulnerability factors involved. Decline and recovery of radial growth were quantified of Douglas-fir in two particularly affected regions with a dendroecological approach; 899 trees were sampled on 58 plots. Mean climate data, ecological and dendrometric stand characteristics were tested in order to identify potential vulnerability factors A clear relationship was evidenced between growth and soil water deficit. A severe decline of radial growth was induced by the 2003 drought and was maintained during subsequent years due to recurrent drought episodes. Growth recovery at the stand level was enhanced by soil nutrient fertility. Radial growth of Douglas-fir is clearly driven by the intensity of drought. In a context of climate change, an adaptive silvicultural strategy is required in order to cope with more frequent drought events. To mitigate the frequency and the intensity of water shortage episodes, site selection must take into account not only local climate characteristic but also soil properties like maximum extractable water content. Soil nitrogen fertility was found to play a key role for an efficient recovery of radial growth after drought episodes and thus must be preserved.},

  abstract = {Relationships between site index, environmental variables, and understorey vegetation were examined for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in the eastern part of France. The study area concerns all the native range of Norway spruce in France and the northeastern plains. The analysis is based on 2087 plots from the French National Forest Inventory database. The data measured on each plot cover topography, soil, geology, and vegetation. Additional environmental variables were estimated using two methods: climatic data estimated from a climatic model developed by Meteo-France (AURELHY), and nutritional variables predicted from vegetation data and species indicator values. General linear model regression was used to predict site index as a function of environmental variables. The best model explains 64% of the site index variance and involves eight variables (elevation, mountain zone, topographic concavity, proportion of plot area occupied by rock outcrop, rock type, soil depth, pH, and C/N ratio). The two main results of this study are (i) the combination of large databases allowed the study of soil-site relationships and construction of a pertinent model, which covers a wide range of ecological conditions, and (ii) vegetation was found to be relevant to separate the effect of acidity from those of nitrogen nutrition on Norway spruce productivity.},

All of these parameters agree well between each other in the high-frequency variability, while the low-frequency climate information shows systematic differences. The correlation analysis with temperature and precipitation data from the closest weather station and gridded data revealed that annual TRW, MXD, CWT, and delta(13)C data contain a strong summer temperature signal, while delta(18)O in cellulose represents a mixed summer and winter temperature and precipitation signal. The temperature and precipitation reconstructions from the Belukha ice core and Teletskoe lake sediments were used to investigate the correspondence of different independent proxies. Low frequency patterns in TRW and delta(13)C chronologies are consistent with temperature reconstructions from nearby Belukha ice core and Teletskoe lake sediments showing a pronounced warming trend in the last century. Their combination could be used for the regional temperature reconstruction. The long-term delta(18)O trend agrees with the precipitation reconstruction from the Teletskoe lake sediment indicating more humid conditions during the twentieth century. Therefore, these two proxies could be combined for the precipitation reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Predicting tree biomass and growth increments via allometric equations is routine in forestry, but this approach is problematic in old-growth forests unless equations are derived from trees spanning the full size range. Using intensive measurements of 27 standing Eucalyptus regnans trees 61.1–99.8 m tall and 80–430 years old in Tasmania, Victoria, and New Zealand, we develop allometric equations to predict aboveground attributes, including biomass and annual growth increments, of trees &gt;60 m tall using ground-based measurements. Power functions of diameter underestimate biomass growth increments unless measurements are made above buttressing on the lower trunk. Growth anomalies apparent in several trees suggest that wounded E. regnans expend considerable energy to outgrow decay fungi and prevent structural collapse. Despite declining growth efficiency – defined as biomass growth per unit mass of photosynthetic tissues – with increasing tree size and age, biomass growth increments of E. regnans increase as trees enlarge with age until extrinsic forces cause mortality. The largest living E. regnans has an aboveground biomass of 215 Mg and a growth increment of 0.784 Mg year−1, not accounting for mass loss due to decay. An even larger E. regnans tree – killed by fire in 2003 – had an aboveground biomass of ∼270 Mg, an estimated growth increment of ∼1 Mg year−1, and was ∼480 years old at the end of its life. Prior to a stand-replacing fire in 2009, Australia’s tallest forest had a maximum aboveground biomass of 1504 Mg ha−1 and a maximum aboveground carbon mass of 706 Mg ha−1.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities exhibit pervasive patterns and interrelationships between size, abundance, and the availability of resources. We use scaling ideas to develop a unified, model-independent framework for understanding the distribution of tree sizes, their energy use, and spatial distribution in tropical forests. We demonstrate that the scaling of the tree crown at the individual level drives the forest structure when resources are fully used. Our predictions match perfectly with the scaling behavior of an exactly solvable self-similar model of a forest and are in good accord with empirical data. The range, over which pure power law behavior is observed, depends on the available amount of resources. The scaling framework can be used for assessing the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem structure and functionality.},

  abstract = {This study challenges all-else-equal assumptions in the analysis of thinning effects and more specifically those regarding local variation in forest site productivity. It is demonstrated that considerable variation may occur in site productivity in apparently homogeneous forest stands, whether thinned or unthinned, and that this may not be reflected in height, but rather in basal area growth. To account for such variation, the suggestion is to include an unbiased pre-treatment measure of site productivity, such as total volume production prior to first thinning, as a covariate in the analysis. In a wider perspective, the study further challenges two general site productivity hypothesis, namely, the general assumption that stand volume growth correlates well with stand height (the site index hypothesis, i.e. that site productivity can be estimated based on stand height) and the assumption that, for a given species, total volume production at a given stand height is identical for all site classes (Eichhorn's rule). The thinning response pattern for even-aged Sitka spruce is quantified for different site types based on two thinning experiments in Denmark and six comparable experiments in Great Britain, Norway and Sweden. The effect of thinning from below on stand volume growth is strongly site dependent, but heavy thinning usually leads to a reduction in volume growth as compared with an unthinned stand growing under similar site conditions. For some sites, typically those with stable and ample water supply and a deeply developed root system, stand volume growth is maximized through light thinning. For some other sites, typically those with a high ground water table and a shallow root system, thinning reduces stand volume growth and considerably so with increasing thinning grade. There seems to be a gradient in the reduction, so that it is lessened with increasing rooting depth and with increasing stability of water supply. Due to site-dependent variation in the relation between height growth and stand volume growth as well as site-dependent variation in thinning response pattern, it is recommended to establish and maintain unthinned observation plots in managed stands to ensure reliable growth and yield prognoses. Such plots can serve as a reference for thinning practices as well as a standard for potential volume growth. This recommendation could also hold for other species and in other parts of the world.},

  abstract = {Forest site productivity is the production that can be realized at a certain site with a given genotype and a specified management regime. Site productivity depends both on natural factors inherent to the site and on management-related factors. This review of the evolution of site assessment highlights three tenets of forest site productivity: the height-age site index, Eichhorn's rule and the thinning response hypothesis. These tenets rely on the hypotheses that height growth correlates well with stand volume growth, that total volume production of a given tree species at a given stand height should be identical for all site classes and that stand volume growth is independent of thinning practice for a wide range of thinning grades. The maturation of long-term field experiments has provided for the revision of these hypotheses, and contributed to an understanding of situations where they do not hold. This led to the introduction of the concept of yield level, the stand volume growth per unit of height growth. The use of the yield level theory for estimating site productivity has facilitated the development of a three-dimensional model of the relationship between stem number, quadratic mean diameter and stand basal area. Given this model, a stand density index based on the combination of stem number and quadratic mean diameter provides an indication of the yield level, which may be used to adjust height-age-based estimates of site productivity.},

Climatic stimuli include changes in long-term mean conditions and variability about means, both current and future, and including extremes.

The nature of adaptation processes and forms can be distinguished by numerous attributes including timing, purposefulness, and effect. The paper notes the contribution of conceptual and numerical models and empirical studies to the understanding of adaptation, and outlines approaches to the normative evaluation of adaptation measures and strategies.},

The total density of all possums and gliders increased linearly with PNT density, in an approx. 1:1 ratio, then plateaued at an av. max. density of 11.3 animals per 3 ha once PNT density exceeded 12 per 3 ha. Regression models predict that G. leadbeateri will be absent from the majority of sites with less than 4.2 PNT per 3 ha and will increase linearly in density to an av. max. of 7.8 animals (or 3.1 colonies) per 3 ha on sites with more than 10 PNT per 3 ha. The absence of G. leadbeateri from sites with fewer than 4.2 PNT per 3 ha was attributed to: competition for hollows from other species; use of more than one PNT by individual colonies; and unsuitability of hollows in up to 2 out of every 3 PNT. Regression models predict that current logging prescriptions in ash forests, which call for retention of a minimum of 15 trees for every 10 ha clear felled, will result in elimination of G. leadbeateri from the majority of clearfelled coupes, and will reduce the total number of hollow-dependent possums and gliders to less than one-eighth of their av. max. density in unlogged forest. A range of forest management options are presented and discussed to ensure the continued availability of PNT for hollow-dependent arboreal mammals in timber production forests.},

The decline in production occurs in young forests, is substantial at young stand ages, and timing of decline can be altered simply by changes in stand density. Changes in physiology of old trees do not account for the near-universal decline in production in developing stands. Rather, peak production and its subsequent decline are associated with inevitable changes in the structure of developing forest stands. Peak production almost invariably occurs as peak community leaf area is obtained. Substantial changes in canopy architecture, production efficiency, and tree population structure occur at this point, resulting in declining stand-level production. These changes are emergent properties that must be studied and understood at the population level, and are not derived from individual tree physiological processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The original prediction was KV0.75. We ask whether trees differ from WBE symmetry and if it matters for plant function and scaling. We measure tree branching and model how architecture influences K, V, mechanical stability, light interception and metabolic scaling. We quantified branching architecture by measuring the path fraction, P-f: mean/maximum trunk-to-twig pathlength. WBE symmetry produces the maximum, P-f=1.0. We explored tree morphospace using a probability-based numerical model constrained only by biomechanical principles. Real tree P-f ranged from 0.930 (nearly symmetric) to 0.357 (very asymmetric). At each modeled tree size, a reduction in P-f led to: increased K; decreased V; increased mechanical stability; and decreased light absorption. When P-f was ontogenetically constant, strong asymmetry only slightly steepened metabolic scaling. The P-f ontogeny of real trees, however, was U' shaped, resulting in size-dependent metabolic scaling that exceeded 0.75 in small trees before falling below 0.65. Architectural diversity appears to matter considerably for whole-tree hydraulics, mechanics, photosynthesis and potentially metabolic scaling. Optimal architectures likely exist that maximize carbon gain per structural investment.},

  abstract = {Radial stem growth and the isotopic composition of growth rings are commonly used to quantify the effects of droughts on trees. However, often these parameters are quantified only at one stem height, e.g., 1.3 m, and it is not known how representative this is for the whole stem. This study investigated radial growth at four stem heights (1.3, 5.5, 9.8 and 14 m) of 21, and wood delta C-13 and delta O-18 at two heights (1.3 and 14 m) of 10 (co-)dominant Norway spruce trees from heavily (HT) and moderately thinned (MT) stands to assess whether different thinning intensities influenced the drought response of stems at different tree heights. Annual basal area increments (BAIs) and stable isotopes in earlywood and latewood were compared between thinning treatments and among the different stem heights. For BAIs, linear correlations with climate were analysed as well. The response of radial growth and isotopic composition to drought was similar at different stem heights in HT trees, but varied with height in MT trees, which were also more sensitive to climatic variations. Recovery of radial growth after drought was more rapid in trees from HT compared with MT stands, except for the topmost height. Basal area increments at breast height (1.3 m) provided good estimates of the volume growth response to drought for the whole stem, but not for its recovery. The faster recovery of radial growth at 1.3 m height of HT compared with MT trees after the 2003 drought was not accompanied by differences in recovery of isotopic composition. However, this is likely to be related to differences between treatments in remobilization of stored C and in tree structure (leaf area, root systems).},

We take account of climate in forest management and this will help us adapt to the effects of climate change on forests. However, society will have to adjust to how forests adapt by changing expectations for the use of forest resources because management can only influence the timing and direction of forest adaptation at selected locations. There will be benefits as well as loses and an important component of adaptation will be balancing values. Adaptation options to respond to impacts on the timber supply in Canada for the next 50 to 100 years are limited mainly to forest protection and wood utilisation because these forests are already in the ground. Adaptation through reforestation will focus on commercial tree species. It is important to start developing adaptation strategies now. These include assessing forest vulnerability to climate change, revising expectations of forest use, determining research and educational needs, development of forest policies to facilitate adaptation, and determining when to implement responses. Government agencies should take the lead in creating an environment to foster adaptation in forestry and in developing the necessary information required to respond.},

  abstract = {Abstract Increasingly, the success of management interventions aimed at biodiversity conservation are viewed as being dependent on the ‘resilience’ of the system. Although the term ‘resilience’ is increasingly used by policy makers and environmental managers, the concept of ‘resilience’ remains vague, varied and difficult to quantify. Here we clarify what this concept means from an ecological perspective, and how it can be measured and applied to ecosystem management. We argue that thresholds of disturbance are central to measuring resilience. Thresholds are important because they offer a means to quantify how much disturbance an ecosystem can absorb before switching to another state, and so indicate whether intervention might be necessary to promote the recovery of the pre-disturbance state. We distinguish between helpful resilience, where resilience helps recovery, and unhelpful resilience where it does not, signalling the presence of a threshold and the need for intervention. Data to determine thresholds are not always available and so we consider the potential for indices of functional diversity to act as proxy measures of resilience. We also consider the contributions of connectivity and scale to resilience and how to incorporate these factors into management. We argue that linking thresholds to functional diversity indices may improve our ability to predict the resilience of ecosystems to future, potentially novel, disturbances according to their spatial and temporal scales of influence. Throughout, we provide guidance for the application of the resilience concept to ecosystem management. In doing so, we confirm its usefulness for improving biodiversity conservation in our rapidly changing world.},

We derived and analysed twelve stand-level mortality models by using four data sets from monospecific even-aged stands. Stand dominant height rather than stand age was incorporated as an indicator of the growth stage and a careful examination of the models conformity with the essential logical properties of the stand-level survival models was conducted. We first tested the models adequacy and general predictive performance by fitting them to parameterization data sets and subsequently assessing them with validation data. The regression equations were re-fitted afterwards over the total data sets to make use of all available information in the final parameter estimates. Nine model formulations were successfully fitted and four of them were the most adequate in describing stand density decrease with dominant height growth. The site-specific effect was incorporated in the newly derived models through the predictor variable and the stand-specific starting density was accounted for through a specific model parameter. These new dominant height-dependent mortality equations can be considered for inclusion in the framework of stand-level growth models as transition functions.},

  abstract = {Millions of hectares of Eucalyptus are intensively managed for wood production in the tropics, but little is known about the physiological processes that control growth and their regulation. We examined the main environmental factors controlling growth and resource use across a geographic gradient with clonal E. grandis × urophylla in north-eastern Brazil. Rates of production and resource use were estimated for 14 stands that spanned a four-fold range in production. The supply of water appeared to be the most limiting resource in these fertilized plantations. Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) increased by 2.3 Mg ha−1 per year for each 100 mm per year increase in rainfall. Higher water supply was also associated with increased use of light and nitrogen (N). The efficiency of resource use (ANPP per unit of resource used) increased with increasing productivity along the gradient. The most efficient stands produced 3.21 kg ANPP m−3 of transpired water, 1.14 kg ANPP GJ−1 absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and 381 kg ANPP kg−1 N taken up. The stands with high resource use and high efficiency also had lower mean vapor pressure deficits, less soil water stress, and smaller coarse root to above-ground biomass ratios. Our study indicates that the productivity of fertilized tropical plantations of Eucalyptus is most likely constrained by water supply, and that water supply substantially affects the efficiency of resource use as well as biomass allocation to roots, stems, and leaves. At a regional scale, our results indicate that high productivity stands could produce wood in a 6-year rotation on half the land area required for low productivity stands, using only half as much water.},

Understanding intergenotypic competitive interactions is important for predicting phenotypic performance, defining growth strategies and ideotypes, and deploying the correct mix of families that possess complementary characteristics for enhanced yield and pest resistance. In 2000, replicated experimental trials were installed in the southeastern United States, controlling for genotype (pure- and mixed-family plantings; consisting of seven full-sibling loblolly and six full-sibling slash pine families), planting density (1334 vs. 2990 trees/ha), and levels of silvicultural treatment intensity (operational vs. intensive). We measured four installations of these trials. There were numerous examples of differential family performance in mixed versus pure plots manifested as significant deployment x family interactions for diameter at breast height, height, basal area, volume, survival, disease, and damage traits. Significant and consistent interactions of several families with mixed versus pure deployment led to the identification of putative crop and competition ideotypes in both loblolly and slash pine. Tree-level crown architectural traits and an index of growth efficiency for the identified families were consistent with the hypothesized ideotypes.},

  abstract = {PROGNAUS is an individual tree growth model, containing a major sub-model which depicts basal area growth as a function of tree size, competition and a set of diagnostic site variables. The coefficients of this model have previously been estimated using the data from the Austrian National Forest (ANF) inventory. The examination of 60 new sample plots in two Austrian growth districts showed that the increment of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) in pure spruce stands was overestimated by this model while it was underestimated in mixed species stands with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). In order to adapt PROGNAUS to account for this effect, the data of the 60 plots were used to modify PROGNAUS by adding quantitative soil characteristics and the percentage of Not-way spruce as variables. The markedly improved model accounts for the effect that in a given stand, below a certain competition level, Norway spruce grows better in the pure stand than in an otherwise comparable mixed species stand. These small spruce trees in mixed stands have a shallow rooting system and therefore suffer from water stress, which is caused by the competing European beech with its higher water consumption. and deeper rooting system. Adding the Norway spruce proportion as an independent variable into the original model and re-parameterising it with the data of the ANF inventory, reveals that this effect can be generalised to some extent, but differs in magnitude depending on the geological substrate.

From the equations describing these relationships the slope of Reineke's maximum density line can be calculated and (for a given data set) tested against the hypothesis that this slope is - 1.605. Data from 134 even- and uneven-aged mixed species stands in northern Idaho and northwestern Montana showed that this slope depended on the skewness of the dbh<SUP>1.5</SUP> distribution, which in turn was correlated with structural stand characteristics like "unevenagedness" and species mixture. The parameters of the extended Competition Density Rule were simultaneously estimated by nonlinear regression under an assumption relating asymptotic dominant height and maximum basal area by habitat type. Results demonstrated that both the maximum basal area at a given dominant height are higher in even-aged pure stands (with smaller skewness of the dbh<SUP>1.5</SUP> distribution) than in uneven-aged mixed stands. Furthermore, the differences in maximum stem number and maximum basal area resulting from differing skewness decrease with increasing dominant height. Large differences in maximum basal area can be shown between different habitat types and any given site index, thus demonstrating that habitat types can be used to distinguish yield levels sensu Assmann.

  abstract = {Although accumulating evidence indicates that local intraspecific density-dependent effects are not as rare in species-rich communities as previously suspected, there are still very few detailed and systematic neighborhood analyses of species-rich communities. Here, we provide such an analysis with the overall goal of quantifying the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific interaction strength in a primary, lowland dipterocarp forest located at Danum, Sabah, Malaysia. Using data on 10 abundant overstory dipterocarp species from two 4-ha permanent plots, we evaluated the effects of neighbors on the absolute growth rate of focal trees (from 1986 to 1996) over increasing neighborhood radii (from 1 to 20 m) with multiple regressions. Only trees 10 cm to < 100 cm girth at breast height in 1986 were considered as focal trees. Among neighborhood models with one neighbor term, models including only conspecific larger trees performed best in five out of 10 species. Negative effects of conspecific larger neighbors were most apparent in large overstory species such as those of the genus Shorea. However, neighborhood models with separate terms and radii for heterospecific and conspecific neighbors accounted for more variability in absolute growth rates than did neighborhood models with one neighbor term. The conspecific term was significant for nine out of 10 species. Moreover, in five out of 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors had significantly higher absolute growth rates than trees with conspecific neighbors. Averaged over the 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors grew 32.4 cm(2) in basal area from 1986 to 1996, whereas trees with conspecific neighbors only grew 14.7 cm(2) in basal area, although there was no difference in initial basal area between trees in the two groups. Averaged across the six species of the genus Shorea, negative effects of conspecific larger trees were significantly stronger than for heterospecific larger neighbors. Thus, high local densities within neighborhoods of 20 m may lead to strong intraspecific negative and, hence, density-dependent, effects even in species rich communities with low overall densities at larger spatial scales. We conjecture that the strength of conspecific effects may be correlated with the degree of host specificity of ectomycorrhizae.},

  abstract = {Pinus radiata D. Don is an internationally important plantation species. The predicted increases in the frequency, duration and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could challenge the commercial viability of P. radiata plantations in several countries where existing plantations are grown in districts already vulnerable to periods of drought. We undertook an empirical approach to examine silvicultural and site factors associated with a significant drought-induced mortality event in southern New South Wales, Australia. The aim was to identify local, practical, risk prevention options for P. radiata plantations exposed to the climatic conditions predicted for this region. Our approach did not rely on ground-based assessment of plots but rather a total census of dead trees across two study areas totalling 10,000 ha of P. radiata, in compartments ranging in age from 0 to 35+ years. Dead tree density counts were derived both manually and automatically from high spatial resolution digital multispectral imagery acquired using a Leica \{ADS40\} Airborne Digital Sensor. The results showed a strong correlation between dead tree densities obtained by the manual detection and the automated process (R = 0.95, P &lt; 0.0001). Two modelling approaches were applied: random forests (RF) and generalised additive models (GAM). For our study sites, both methodologies identified a similar set of parameters, with time since planting in unthinned stands being the most influential variable, and terrain variables playing a smaller role. Specifically, the models identified a threshold age at around 17–18 years for stands on good quality sites and before age 16 on poorer quality sites before the on-set of catastrophic mortality under severe drought conditions. Both modelling techniques also identified similar trends with respect to elevation and slope, and indirectly, site quality. These site attributes being likely to contribute to water availability. If stands in this area are to be planted at 1000 stems ha−1 and thinning schedules cannot be met, then we recommend avoiding sites having a mean elevation of below 600 m or to establish these sites with drought-tolerant genotypes. These recommendations cannot be extrapolated beyond the range of the data. However, the application of robust image classification techniques (e.g. automated tree counts) to high spatial resolution digital imagery, the increasing availability of high resolution climatic, terrain and edaphic \{GIS\} datasets, as well as readily available spatial modelling packages, helps off-set the limitations in transferability of our empirical approach. },

Despite previous reports showing higher shoot vulnerability to water-stress-induced cavitation in ponderosa pine, this species extends into drier habitats than Douglas-fir. We examined: (1) whether roots and shoots of ponderosa pine in riparian and slope habitats are more vulnerable to water-stress-induced cavitation than those of Douglas-fir; (2) whether species-specific differences in vulnerability translate into differences in specific conductivity in the field; and (3) whether the ability of ponderosa pine to extend into drier sites is a result of (a) greater plasticity in hydraulic properties or (b) functional or structural adjustments. Roots and shoots of ponderosa pine were significantly more vulnerable to water-stress-induced cavitation (overall mean cavitation pressure, Psi(50%) +/- SE = -3.11 +/- 0.32 MPa for shoots and -0.99 +/- 0.16 MPa for roots) than those of Douglas-fir (Psi(50%) +/- SE = -4.83 +/- 0.40 MPa for shoots and -2.12 +/- 0.35 MPa for roots). However, shoot specific conductivity did not differ between species in the field. For both species, roots were more vulnerable to cavitation than shoots. Overall, changes in vulnerability from riparian to slope habitats were small for both species. Greater declines in stomatal conductance as the summer proceeded, combined with higher allocation to sapwood and greater sapwood water storage, appeared to contribute to the ability of ponderosa pine to thrive in dry habitats despite relatively high vulnerability to water-stress-induced cavitation.

  abstract = {Understanding forest complexity and self-organization across multiple scales is essential for both ecology and natural resource management. In this paper, we develop a Markov chain approach for the modelling of forest stand dynamics. The aim of this work is to generalize the recently developed Perfect Plasticity Approximation (PPA) model for scaling of vegetation dynamics from individual level to the landscape level through the ecosystem hierarchical structure. Our basic assumption is that the forested ecosystem and disturbance regimes can be modelled on 3 hierarchical scales (levels): individual trees, forest stand (or patch, defined as a spatial unit about 0.5–1 ha of the same forest at one successional stage.) and landscape (collection of forest patches of different forest/soil types at different successional stages) levels. In our modelling approach the PPA model is an intermediate step for scaling from the individual level to the forest stand level (or patch level). In this paper we develop a Markov chain model for stage-structured dynamics of forest stands (patches). In order to determine the structure of the Markov chain model and estimate parameters, we analyze the patch-mosaic patterns of forest stands of the Lake States (MI, WI, and MN) recorded in the USDA FIA database as well as data for other US states and Canada. The distribution of macroscopic characteristics of a large collection of forest patches is considered as an estimate of the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain. The data demonstrates that this distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We identify the simplest Markov chain that produces such a distribution and estimate the upper bound of the probability of disaster for this Markov chain.},

  abstract = {Stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) are commonly used measures of tree growth. We examined patterns of height growth and diameter growth along a stem using a 20-year record of an even-aged hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold & Zucc.) Endl.) stand. In the region of the stem below the crown (except for the butt swell), diameter growth rates (ΔD) at different heights tended to increase slightly from breast height upwards. This increasing trend was pronounced in suppressed trees, but not as much as the variation in ΔD among individual trees. Hence, ΔD below the crown can be regarded as generally being represented by the DBH growth rate (ΔDBH) of a tree. Accordingly, the growth rate of the stem cross-sectional area increased along the stem upwards in suppressed trees, but decreased in dominant trees. The stem diameter just below the crown base (DCB), the square of which is an index of the amount of leaves on a tree, was an important factor affecting ΔDBH. DCB also had a strong positive relationship with crown length. Hence, long-term changes in the DCB of a tree were associated with long-term changes in crown length, determined by the balance between the height growth rate (ΔH) and the rising rate of the crown base (ΔHCB). Within the crown, ΔD's were generally greater than the rates below the crown. Even dying trees (ΔD ≈ 0 below the crown) maintained ΔD > 0 within the crown and ΔH > 0 until about 5 years before death. This growth within the crown may be related to the need to produce new leaves to compensate for leaves lost owing to the longevity of the lower crown. These results explain the different time trajectories in DBH–H relationships among individual trees, and also the long-term changes in the DBH–H relationships. The view that a rise in the crown base is strongly related to leaf turnover helps to interpret DBH–H relationships.},

Using probit regression analysis, we identified a strong relationship between the age of a Mountain Ash forest and the severity of damage that the forest sustained from the fires under extreme weather conditions. Stands of Mountain Ash trees between the ages of 7 to 36 years mostly sustained canopy consumption and scorching, which are impacts resulting from high-severity fire. High-severity fire leading to canopy consumption almost never occurred in young stands (<7 years) and also was infrequent in older (>40 years) stands of Mountain Ash. We discuss the significant forest conservation and management implications of these results for Mountain Ash forests as well as other similar biomes, where high-severity fire is a common form of disturbance.},

The main objective of this study was to develop models for predicting stand-level mortality of loblolly pine plantations using stand characteristics and climate and soil variables. Models were constructed using two modeling approaches. In the first approach, mortality functions for directly predicting tree number reduction were developed using an algebraic difference equation method. In the second approach, a two-step modeling strategy was used. In the first step, a model predicting the probability of tree death occurring in a stand over a measurement period was developed; in the second step, a function that estimates the reduction in tree number was fitted. Performance of all the approaches was compared using leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation. When climate and soil variables were used in the model, the direct prediction approach performed the best.},

  abstract = {Climate extremes are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude as a consequence of global warming, threatening the functioning, services and goods of forest ecosystems. Across Europe, the ecologically and economically important tree species Fagus sylvatica is expected to suffer particularly under such conditions. The regional introduction of provenances from drier and warmer climates is one option to adapt beech forest ecosystems to these adverse effects of climate change. Marginal populations from the drought-prone southern and north-eastern edges of the species' distribution come into focus in search of suitable candidates for Central European deciduous forests. Here, we test three marginal provenances (Spain, Bulgaria and Poland) and three provenances from the centre of the distribution range (Germany) for their response to drought in two different soil types (sand, loam) in a full factorial common garden experiment in Landau, Germany. Drought impacted all growth parameters negatively (leaf damage +22 % (percentage points), height -40 % and diameter increment -41 %), and the sandy substrate exacerbated this effect. However, provenances differed in their response to drought and soil type. Evidence for a local adaptation to summer drought was detected, especially in terms of mortality rates. The Bulgarian and Spanish provenance showed a stable performance under drought conditions (BG -27 % in diameter increment; ES -32 %), compared to the Polish (-48 %) or the most sensitive German provenances (-57 %), yet for Bulgaria on a low level of total increment. This may indicate a trade-off between drought tolerance and growth. Therefore, a sole focus on drought-resistant marginal provenances seems to not be conducive, as they might be less adapted to other climatic factors, e.g. frost, as well. However, intermixed with local Central European provenances, these may act as functional insurance in future drought-prone forest stands.},

  abstract = {A model of stem height and diameter growth in plants is developed. This is formulated and implemented within the framework of an existing tree plantation growth model: the ITE Edinburgh Forest Model. It is proposed that the height:diameter growth rate ratio is a function of a within-plant allocation ratio determined by the transport-resistance model of partitioning, multiplied by a foliage turgor pressure modifier. First it is demonstrated that the method leads to a stable long-term growth trajectory. Diurnal and seasonal dynamics are also examined. Predicted time courses over 20 years of stem mass, stem height, height:diameter ratio, and height:diameter growth rate ratio are presented for six treatments: control, high nitrogen, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, increased planting density, increased temperature and decreased rainfall. High nitrogen and increased temperature give initially higher stem height:diameter ratios, whereas high CO2gives an initially lower stem height:diameter ratio. However, the responses are complex, reflecting interactions between factors which often have opposing influences on height:diameter ratios, for example: stem density, competition for light and for nitrogen; carbon dioxide and decreased water stress; rainfall, leaching and nitrogen nutrition. The approach relates stem height and diameter growth variables via internal plant variables to environmental and management variables. Potentially, a coherent view of many observations which are sometimes in apparent conflict is provided. These aspects of plant growth can be considered more mechanistically than has hitherto been the case, providing an alternative to the empirical or teleonomic methods which have usually been employed.Copyright 1999 Annals of Botany Company},

Our results support the diversity-stability hypothesis5,6,18,19, but not the alternative hypothesis that most species are functionally redundant19-21.

Here we use a well-replicated field experiment, in which species diversity was directly controlled, to show that ecosystem productivity in 147 grassland plots increased significantly with plant biodiversity, Moreover, the main limiting nutrient, soil mineral nitrogen, was utilized more completely when there was a greater diversity of species, leading to lower leaching loss of nitrogen from these ecosystems. Similarly, in nearby native grassland, plant productivity and soil nitrogen utilization increased with increasing plant species richness. This supports the diversity-productivity and diversity-sustainability hypotheses. Our results demonstrate that the loss of species threatens ecosystem functioning and sustainability.},

It consists on 5 thinning intensities with 5 repetitions. Radial growth pattern in each thinning modality has been compared and annual interactions between radial growth and water balance - from Thornthwaite ETP formula - have been studied in the Landes soils and climate environment. At high thinning intensity, trees display higher water stress resistance. Nevertheless, during the years with very low rainfall, radial growth is much reduced in high thinning intensity plots, which is a mesophytic trait. During this thinning experiment, with tree age ranking from 20 to 35, thinning effect duration was no longer than 4-5 years. On a sylvicultural view-point, these results point out the interest of frequent thinning practices (every 4 or 5 years) with an economical equilibrium between high thinning intensity and stand density.},

Among them, five are of major economic and ecological importance, either because of the quality and value of their wood or because of their geographic extension, or both. Two of these species are widespread in the hills and plains of the Atlantic and of the mid-European domains: Q petraea (sessile oak), and Q robur (pedunculate oak). Four are present in the Mediterranean region: Q pubescens (pubescent oak), Q ilex (holm oak), Q suber (cork oak) and Q coccifera (kermes oak). Pubescent oak is also present in the Atlantic and mid-European regions provided the local soil and climate conditions are favorable. The last species is of very limited extent and will not be considered further in this review. First, we will analyze the distributions of these species in France, as they result from the vegetation dynamics in Europe and the long-lasting action of man. Second, their synecology will be described, based on the empirical knowledge accumulated by botanists and phytoecologists. We will then describe the vegetation series to which they are related. We will next consider the results of ecophysiologal studies of the species, carried out in many laboratories in France and in other European countries. Finally, we will review the sylvicultural practices applied to oak forests, their productivity under different local conditions and the diverse products they yield.},

We examined the effects of climate, soil and logging disturbances on diameter growth rates at the tree and stand level, using 165 1-ha permanent sample plots distributed across Bolivian tropical lowland forests. 2. We predicted that growth rates would be higher in humid than in dry forests, higher in nutrient-rich than nutrient-poor forests and higher in logged than non-logged forests. 3. Across the 165 plots we found positive basal area increases at the stand level, which agree with the generally reported biomass increases in tropical forests. 4. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that climate variables, in particular water availability, were the strongest drivers of tree growth. More rainfall, a shorter and less intense dry period and higher temperatures led to higher tree growth rates. 5. Tree growth increased modestly with soil fertility and basal area growth was greatest at intermediate soil fertility. Surprisingly, tree growth showed little or no relationship with total soil nitrogen or plant available soil phosphorus. 6. Growth rates increased in logged plots just after logging, but this effect disappeared after 6 years. 7. Synthesis. Climate is the strongest driver of spatial variation in tree growth, and climate change may therefore have large consequences for forest productivity and carbon sequestration. The negative impact of decreased rainfall and increased rainfall seasonality on tree growth might be partly offset by the positive impact of increased temperature in these forests.},

  abstract = {We present a simple, efficient, process-based forward model of tree-ring growth, called Vaganov-Shashkin-Lite (VS-Lite), that requires as inputs only latitude and monthly temperature and precipitation. Simulations of six bristlecone pine ring-width chronologies demonstrate the interpretability of model output as an accurate representation of the climatic controls on growth. Ensemble simulations by VS-Lite of two networks of North American ring-width chronologies correlate with observations at higher significance levels on average than simulations formed by regression of ring width on the principal components of the same monthly climate data. VS-Lite retains more skill outside of calibration intervals than does the principal components regression approach. It captures the dominant low- and high-frequency spatiotemporal ring-width signals in the network with an inhomogeneous, multivariate relationship to climate. Because continuous meteorological data are most widely available at monthly temporal resolution, our model extends the set of sites at which forward-modeling studies are possible. Other potential uses of VS-Lite include generation of synthetic ring-width series for pseudo-proxy studies, as a data level model in data assimilation-based climate reconstructions, and for bias estimation in actual ring-width index series.},

  abstract = {We use the process-based VS (Vaganov-Shashkin) model to investigate whether a regional Pinus halepensis tree-ring chronology from Tunisia can be simulated as a function of climate alone by employing a biological model linking day length and daily temperature and precipitation (AD 1959-2004) from a climate station to ring-width variations. We check performance of the model on independent data by a validation exercise in which the model's parameters are tuned using data for 1982-2004 and the model is applied to generate tree-ring indices for 1959-1981. The validation exercise yields a highly significant positive correlation between the residual chronology and estimated growth curve (r=0.76 p < 0.0001, n=23). The model shows that the average duration of the growing season is 191 days, with considerable variation from year to year. On average, soil moisture limits tree-ring growth for 128 days and temperature for 63 days. Model results depend on chosen values of parameters, in particular a parameter specifying a balance ratio between soil moisture and precipitation. Future work in the Mediterranean region should include multi-year natural experiments to verify patterns of cambial-growth variation suggested by the VS model.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the variability in the relationship between climate and radial growth of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.s.P.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) trees across central Labrador, Eastern Canada. Using climate-sensitive trees, an 11-year running Pearson correlation is applied to local records to examine the relationship between radial tree growth and climate over the last 50 years and the spatial pattern in this relationship with increasing distance inland from the Labrador Sea. Results indicate that there is a high degree of instability in the climate/tree-ring sensitivity despite an overall statistically significant relationship throughout the instrumental time period (1942 to present). Although some periods of reduced climate sensitivity are coincident with insect outbreaks, others cannot be explained by forest disturbance factors. Spatially, the two sites that are most representative of higher elevation areas have more time-stable climate-growth relationships than those inland or along the coast. The results also suggest that the stability of the relationship may be the result of moisture availability, rapid changes in precipitation and temperature, and site-specificity.

  abstract = {Abstract Context: Growth partitioning among trees in forest stands is pivotal to silviculture, making it crucial to understand its control by factors such as stand development, stand density, or thinning. Since growth partitioning primarily depends on the partitioning of environmental resources among individuals, climatic change further calls for extending this framework to explicit climatic factors. Recent debate on adapting management to such changes also requires larger density gradients to be encompassed. Methods: We primarily aimed to investigate the effects of stand density and climatic factors on growth partitioning, in even-aged stands of sessile oak and Douglas-fir, two species currently managed under contrasted silvicultural regimes. We used two original permanent plot networks designed to explore effects of large density gradients, from open-grown to self-thinning situations. Growth partitioning was assessed on basal area growth, using both the growth dominance index, and the within-stand size-growth relationship. Their dependence on stand density, age, thinning, and climatic predictors was modeled statistically. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis of these models was performed to evaluate the magnitude of the effect of each predictor on growth partitioning. Simulations of the effect of extreme climatic conditions on stand growth, and on dominant, intermediate and close-to-suppressed trees growth were also performed. Results: For both species, stand density was found to strongly increase growth partitioning toward the biggest trees. Stand growth in sessile oak was reduced by high summer soil water deficit, with a particularly severe growth reduction for suppressed trees, suggesting asymmetric belowground competition for water in this species. In Douglas-fir, a stand growth reduction was found for high summer temperatures, with an increase in growth dominance that suggested a higher temperature-driven stress for suppressed trees. In addition, age slightly increased/decreased growth dominance in sessile oak/Douglas-fir, respectively. Conclusions: Growth dominance and size-growth relationships offered complementary insight into growth partitioning. Stand density appears to be the major driver of growth partitioning. Climatic factors were also shown to significantly affect growth partitioning, with species differences, in addition to stand density and ageing. These results suggest to maintain stands at medium density levels to reduce rotation length and minimize risk of exposure to extreme climatic events.},

  abstract = {Even-aged forest stands are competitive communities where competition for light gives advantages to tall individuals, thereby inducing a race for height. These same individuals must however balance this competitive advantage with height-related mechanical and hydraulic risks. These phenomena may induce variations in height–diameter growth relationships, with primary dependences on stand density and tree social status as proxies for competition pressure and access to light, and on availability of local environmental resources, including water. We aimed to investigate the effects of stand density, tree social status and water stress on the individual height–circumference growth allocation (Δh–Δc), in even-aged stands of Quercus petraea Liebl. (sessile oak). Within-stand Δc was used as surrogate for tree social status. We used an original long-term experimental plot network, set up in the species production area in France, and designed to explore stand dynamics on a maximum density gradient. Growth allocation was modelled statistically by relating the shape of the Δh–Δc relationship to stand density, stand age and water deficit. The shape of the Δh–Δc relationship shifted from linear with a moderate slope in open-grown stands to concave saturating with an initial steep slope in closed stands. Maximum height growth was found to follow a typical mono-modal response to stand age. In open-grown stands, increasing summer soil water deficit was found to decrease height growth relative to radial growth, suggesting hydraulic constraints on height growth. A similar pattern was found in closed stands, the magnitude of the effect however lowering from suppressed to dominant trees. We highlight the high phenotypic plasticity of growth in sessile oak trees that further adapt their allocation scheme to their environment. Stand density and tree social status were major drivers of growth allocation variations, while water stress had a detrimental effect on height in the Δh–Δc allocation.},

  abstract = {Invasion of non-native species is among the top threats for the biodiversity and functioning of native and agricultural ecosystems worldwide. We investigated whether the herbivory of the slug Arion vulgaris (formerly Arion lusitanicus; Gastropoda), that is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe, is affected by soil organisms commonly present in terrestrial ecosystems (i.e. earthworms-Annelida: Lumbricidae and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-AMF, Glomerales). We hypothesized that slug herbivory would be affected by soil organisms via altered plant nutrient availability and plant quality. In a greenhouse experiment, we created a simple plant community consisting of a grass, a forb, and a legume species and inoculated these systems with either two earthworm species and/or four AMF taxa. Slugs were introduced after plants were established. Earthworms significantly reduced total slug herbivory in AMF-inoculated plant communities (P = 0.013). Across plant species, earthworms increased leaf total N and secondary metabolites, AMF decreased leaf thickness. Mycorrhizae induced a shift in slug feeding preference from non-legumes to legumes; the grass was generally avoided by slugs. AMF effects on legume herbivory can partly be explained by the AMF-induced increase in total N and decrease in C/N ratio; earthworm effects are less clear as no worm-induced alterations of legume plant chemistry were observed. The presence of earthworms increased average AMF colonization of plant roots by 140 % (P < 0.001). Total shoot mass was significantly increased by AMF (P < 0.001). These data suggest that the feeding behavior of this invasive slug is altered by a belowground control of plant chemical quality and community structure.},

  abstract = {In this paper we review vulnerability to embolism caused by drought and freezing in six species of oak (Quercus). The xylem pressure potential that induces 50% loss hydraulic conductivity ranges from -2.5 to -6.0 MPa for the species reviewed and correlates with other measures of drought tolerance in oaks. The probability of vessel dysfunction increases with vessel size for both drought- and freezing-induced embolism. The impact of embolism is a reduction in hydraulic conductivity in the vascular system. We conclude that embolism plays little role in the drought tolerance of oaks since drought-induced embolism occurs at more negative water potentials than are known to cause damage (eg, reduced growth) or mortality. Nevertheless, vulnerability to embolisms probably explains species distributions between wet and dry sites or may explain the evolution of stomatal physiology. Oaks seem to operate close to the point of xylem dysfunction, but oaks protect against embolism by stomatal regulation which keeps water potentials above that causing 'run-away' embolism. In conclusion, vulnerability to summer embolisms correlates with other measures of drought tolerance of oak species but significant summer embolisms are generally avoided. On the other hand, frost-induced embolism may explain species distributions in cold climates.},

The growth model is grounded in pipe model theory and an optimal control model of crown development. Together, the pipe model and the optimal control model provide a framework for expressing the components of tree biomass in terms of three standard inventory variables: tree height, crown height and stem cross-sectional area. Growth rates of the inventory variables and the components of biomass are formulated from a carbon balance. Fundamentally, the parameters of the model comprise physiological rates and morphological ratios. In principle, the values of these parameters may be estimated by lower-level process models. Alternatively, the physiological and morphological parameters combine, under reasonable assumptions, into a set of aggregate parameters, whose values can be estimated from inventory data with a statistical fitting procedure.},

Is a mixed Norway spruce-silver fir stand more productive than pure adjacent stands of either species? How to develop generic modelling approaches to assess mixture effects in forest stands? Location: In addition to a case study on Norway spruce-silver fir stands in French mountain forests, the generic approach used goes beyond local applications. Methods: We took advantage of National Forest Inventory data to develop a unique stand basal-area-increment model for pure and mixed stands of Norway spruce and silver fir that responds to ecological site conditions. The database was made up of 284 pure Norway spruce stands, 196 pure silver fir stands, and 323 mixed stands of these species. Results: Pure silver fir basal area increment is strongly influenced by spring climatic conditions, whereas pure Norway spruce is more influenced by soil conditions. The mixture of these species has a positive effect on silver fir, which decreases as the proportion of fir increases. In contrast, the mixture has no noticeable effect on Norway spruce. Conclusion: We developed a stand basal-area-increment model evidencing an advantage of the mixture on silver fir basal area increment, but not on Norway spruce. The mathematical formulation of the model developed is generic and can be used in all two-species mixture situations. It also makes it possible to compare different mixture situations with each other.},

  abstract = {Calibration of the self-thinning frontier in even-aged monocultures is hampered by scarce data and by subjective decisions about the proximity of data to the frontier. We present a simple model that applies to observations of the full trajectory of stand mean diameter across a range of densities not necessarily close to the frontier. Development of the model is based on a consideration of the slope s = ln(Nt/Nt−1)/ln(Dt/Dt−1) of a log-transformed plot of stocking Nt and mean stem diameter Dt at time t. This avoids the need for subjective decisions about limiting density and allows the use of abundant data further from the self-thinning frontier. The model can be solved analytically and yields equations for the stocking and the stand basal area as an explicit function of stem diameter. It predicts that self-thinning may be regulated by the maximum basal area with a slope of −2. The significance of other predictor variables offers an effective test of competing self-thinning theories such Yoda's −3/2 power rule and Reineke's stand density index.},

  abstract = {A dendroecological study of Norway spruce trees was undertaken by Eckstein et al. (1989) as part of an interdisciplinary project investigating the influence of air pollution on tree growth in northern Germany. They analyzed individual trees stratified according to three different canopy classes and three different vitality classes, using response function analysis (Fritts 1976). Eckstein et al. conclude that there is a significant positive correlation between precipitation during the growing season and the tree-ring series, and that the observed forest decline is probably caused by a severe unknown stress factor (but clearly not a climate factor) during the mid-1950s. The use of response functions has the limitation of time invariance and the separated adjustment of trend and climate variables for the tree-ring series. In this article a model is applied for simultaneous adjustment of trend and explanatory variables for tree-ring chronologies. Time-dependent or stochastic response functions are obtained by writing these models in the so-called state-space form and analyzing them with the discrete Kalman filter. Consequences for chronology building are discussed. After analyzing the tree-ring chronologies of the Norway spruce by these more sophisticated methods, it is found that: 1. the stochastic response functions for precipitation during the growing season are principally constant over time and positive, 2. the stochastic response functions for the temperature in February and March are not constant and become significant after the mid-1950s for trees from the classes "not dominant-vital," "not dominant-moderately vital," "dominant-not vital," "moderately dominant-not vital," and "not dominant-not vital," 3. the influence of climate factors on tree-ring development is higher if the vitality and dominance of the trees is lower, 4. addition of an SO<SUB>2</SUB> emission curve as explanatory variable, simultaneously with trend and climate variables for tree-ring chronologies, did not reveal a significant air pollution effect on tree-ring development.

  abstract = {Understanding self-thinning patterns of a species helps resource managers make decisions about proper planting densities and timings of thinnings. It is generally assumed that size density trajectories of even-aged, monospecific, self-thinning stands consist of three phases: first, a curved approach to a linear portion that represents moderate rates of intraspecific mortality; second, a linear portion where tree density/ha (N) is at its maximum for a particular quadratic mean diameter (D(q)), often termed the maximum size density relationship (MSDR) dynamic thinning line; and third, a divergence from the linear portion. In this article, segmented regression was used to determine what observations are within various phases of self-thinning for a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) planting density trial located in central Mississippi. Those observations estimated to be within the MSDR dynamic thinning line phase of individual plots were combined to estimate a MSDR species boundary line slope (-1.640) using a linear mixed-effects model approach. Based on the N and D(q), where the MSDR dynamic thinning line phase was estimated to begin using segmented regression analyses, and the estimated MSDR species boundary line slope of -1.640, planting density-specific maximum values of Reineke's stand density index were predicted.

  abstract = {Maximum size-density relationships (MSDR) provide natural resource managers useful information about the relationship between tree density and average tree size. Obtaining a valid estimate of how maximum tree density changes with changes in average tree size is necessary to describe these biological relationships accurately. This article examines three methods to estimate the slope (<i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">b</i>) of the MSDR species boundary line across a range of planting densities: ordinary least-squares (OLS), first-difference model, and the linear mixed-effects model. For this article, stability refers to the extent to which parameter estimates do not change when the range of planting densities in the fitting data set changes. When using data from a planting density trial consisting of planting densities ranging from 6,727 to 747 seedlings per hectare, mixed-effect models produced the most stable estimates of <i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">b</i> while OLS resulted in the least stable estimates. MSDR boundaries have been defined as either (1) those that describe the boundaries of individual stands (MSDR dynamic thinning line) or (2) those that describe MSDRs common across all sites for a particular species in a certain geographical region (MSDR species boundary line). A further refinement of the MSDR species boundary line is proposed by defining two MSDR species boundary lines, labeled here as <b xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">I</b> and <b xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">II</b>. Although both MSDR species boundary lines are positioned above all observations, one MSDR species boundary line, <b xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">II</b>, has a slope that can be considered the population average of all MSDR dynamic thinning lines; the other species boundary line (<b xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">I</b>) has a slope that results from positioning the boundary above all observations without accounting for self-thinning patterns of individual stands.

  abstract = {In forests of the western United States, high levels of forest stocking attributed to fire exclusion and settlement-era logging practices have coincided with periods of extensive forest mortality associated with extreme drought and forest pest outbreaks. This has led to the widespread but largely untested generalization that increased stand density causes increased levels of forest mortality, even for uneven-aged, multi-species, mature stands that are not actively undergoing self-thinning. We used archival Landsat imagery to examine: (1) variations in forest mortality among forest types and climate periods from 1985 to 2010 in the mixed conifer forest of the Lake Tahoe Basin, (2) relationships between stand density and mortality in the subsequent year, and (3) the influence of environmental variables on forest mortality. We found that positive density dependent mortality, where increased stand density is associated with increased probability of mortality, is associated more with lower elevation forests and drier climate periods. In mid- to upper-elevation forests, increased density was more often associated with decreased probability of mortality, especially during wetter periods. Results showed highest tree mortality during a drought in the beginning of our 25-year time series, but not in a subsequent drought period of similar severity. Our study also found increased risk of tree mortality on north-facing slopes across all forests and all climate periods, even when stand density was controlled for. There is a nuanced relationship between stocking level, forest mortality and drought effects, suggesting that no single density-reduction forest management strategy will increase forest resilience under all climate periods and in all forest types.},

  abstract = {Site index (SI) is one of the main measures of forest productivity in North America. For monospecific even-age stands, it is defined as the height of dominant trees at a given reference age or presented as an age–height curve. SI normally reflects the overall effect of all the environmental parameters that determine height growth locally. However, measuring SI can only be achieved though field observations and is, for this reason, limited to sample plots. In this study, we propose a new method for quantifying and mapping SI and age based on known age–height curves and time series of canopy height models (CHMs) produced using digital photogrammetry and lidar. Digital surface models (DSMs) are created by applying an automated stereo-matching algorithm to scanned aerial photographs. The canopy height is obtained by subtracting the lidar ground elevations from the DSM. Using aerial photographs covering the 1945–2003 interval and a recent lidar coverage, CHMs could be reconstructed retrospectively for a period of over 58 years. Regionally calibrated age–height curves were fitted to observations that were extracted cell-wise from the historical CHMs to estimate SI and age values for all undisturbed locations. Results demonstrate that SI and age of jack pine (Pinus banksiana [Lamb.]) stands can be quantified respectively with an average bias of 0.76 m (2.41 m root mean squared error, RMSE) and 1.86 years (7 years RMSE). The method can be used to produce quasi-continuous maps of SI and age and to estimate productivity in a spatially explicit way.},

  abstract = {There is a well-documented empirical relationship between stand age and water yield for mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forested catchments in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. Catchments covered with old-growth stands of mountain ash yield almost twice the amount of water annually as those covered with re-growth stands aged 25 years. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic hydro-ecologic explanation for this phenomenon. We measured leaf area index (LAI), sapwood area index (SAI) and various water balance components in several mountain ash stands, ranging in age between 5 and 240 years. Sap flow measurements show that sap velocity does not vary appreciably amongst stands of different ages, but a systematic decline in SAI with age produces a concomitant decrease in stand transpiration. The decline in overstory SAI is accompanied by a decline in overstory LAI. Understory LAI increases as the overstory LAI decreases, but this layer transpires at only about 63% of the mountain ash rate on a per unit leaf area basis. Hence, while total stand LAI decreases are modest over time, the trend is for a significant decline in total stand transpiration as the forest ages. Rainfall interception also declined over time and there was some indication that interception per unit leaf area also declined. Such reductions can be explained by lesser turbulent mixing and elevated humidity around the bulk of the leaf area in the mature forest. There were small decreases in forest floor evaporation through time, though this only accounted for about 5–8% of the site water balance. Our water balance measurements agree qualitatively with empirical water yield relationships developed for mountain ash forests, though the magnitudes of change differ.},

  abstract = {Tree species differences in crown size and shape are often highlighted as key characteristics determining light interception strategies and successional dynamics. The phenotypic plasticity of species in response to light and space availability suggests that intraspecific variability can have potential consequences on light interception and community dynamics. Species crown size varies depending on site characteristics and other factors at the individual level which differ from competition for light and space. These factors, such as individual genetic characteristics, past disturbances or environmental micro-site effects, combine with competition-related phenotypic plasticity to determine the individual variability in crown size. Site and individual variability are typically ignored when considering crown size and light interception by trees, and residual variability is relegated to a residual error term, which is then ignored when studying ecological processes. In the present study, we structured and quantified variability at the species, site, and individual levels for three frequently used tree allometric relations using fixed and random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We focused on two species: Abies alba (silver fir) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) in nine forest stands of the western Alps. We demonstrated that species had different allometric relations from site to site and that individual variability accounted for a large part of the variation in allometric relations. Using a spatially explicit radiation transmission model on real stands, we showed that individual variability in tree allometry had a substantial impact on light resource allocation in the forest. Individual variability in tree allometry modulates species' light-intercepting ability. It generates heterogeneous light conditions under the canopy, with high light micro-habitats that may promote the regeneration of light-demanding species and slow down successional dynamics.},

  abstract = {Dendrochronology generally assumes that climate-growth relationships are age independent once the biological growth trend has been removed. However, tree physiology, namely, photosynthetic capacity and hydraulic conductivity changes with age. We tested whether the radial-growth response to climate and the intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) of Pinus pinaster Ait. varied with age. Trees were sampled in Pinhal de Leiria (Portugal), and were divided in two age classes: young (< 65 years old) and old (> 115 years old). Earlywood and tree-ring width of young P. pinaster trees were more sensitive to climate influence while the response of latewood width to climate was stronger in old trees. Young trees start the growing season earlier, thus a time window delay occurs between young and old trees during which wood cells of young trees integrate environmental signals. Young trees usually have a longer growing season and respond faster to climate conditions, thus young P. pinaster trees presented a higher frequency of IADFs compared with old trees. Most of the IADFs were located in latewood and were positively correlated to autumn precipitation. The radial-growth response of P. pinaster to climate and the IADFs frequency were age dependent. The use of trees with different age to create a tree-ring chronology for climate studies can increase the resolution of climatic signals. Age-dependent responses to climate can also give important clues to predict how young and old trees react to climate change.},

On average, wood production was 24% higher in mixed than in monospecific forests. Taken alone, wood production was enhanced with increasing tree species richness in almost all forest types. In some forests, wood production was also greater with increasing numbers of tree types.

  abstract = {A major debate in the study of biodiversity concerns its influence on ecosystem functioning. We compared whether wood production in forests was associated with tree functional group identity (i.e. deciduous, conifer or sclerophylous), tree species richness (1->= 5) and tree functional group richness (1-3) by comparing more than 5000 permanent plots distributed across Catalonia (NE Spain). Deciduous forests were more productive than coniferous and sclerophylous forests. Wood production increased with tree species richness. However, functional group richness increased wood production only in sclerophylous forests. When other forest structure, environmental variables and management practices were included in the analysis, tree functional group identity and species richness still remained significant, while functional species richness did not. Our survey indicates that across a regional scale, and across a broad range of environmental conditions, a significant positive association exists between local tree species richness and wood production at least in typical early successional Mediterranean-type forests.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental advances on the positive effect of species richness on ecosystem productivity highlight the need to explore this relationship in communities other than grasslands and using non-synthetic experiments. We investigated whether wood production in forests dominated by Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) and Pyrenean Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) differed between monospecific and mixed forests (2-5 species) using the Ecological and Forest Inventory of Catalonia (IEFC) database which contains biotic and environmental characteristics for 10,644 field plots distributed within a 31,944 km(2) area in Catalonia (NE Spain). We found that in Pyrenean Scots pine forests wood production was not significantly different between monospecific and mixed plots. In contrast, in Aleppo pine forests wood production was greater in mixed plots than in monospecific plots. However, when climate, bedrock types, radiation and successional stage per plot were included in the analysis, species richness was no longer a significant factor. Aleppo pine forests had the highest productivity in plots located in humid climates and on marls and sandstone bedrocks. Climate did not influence wood production in Pyrenean Scots pine forests, but it was highest on sandstone and consolidated alluvial materials. For both pine forests wood production was negatively correlated with successional stage. Radiation did not influence wood production. Our analysis emphasizes the influence of macroenvironmental factors and temporal variation on tree productivity at the regional scale. Well-conducted forest surveys are an excellent source of data to test for the association between diversity and productivity driven by large-scale environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Evidence has been found for reduced sensitivity of tree growth to temperature in a number of forests at high northern latitudes and alpine locations. Furthermore, at some of these sites, emergent subpopulations of trees show negative growth trends with rising temperature. These findings are typically referred to as the 'Divergence Problem' (DP). Given the high relevance of paleoclimatic reconstructions for policy-related studies, it is important for dendrochronologists to address this issue of potential model uncertainties associated with the DP. Here we address this issue by proposing a calibration technique, termed 'stochastic response function' (SRF), which allows the presence or absence of any instabilities in growth response of trees (or any other climate proxy) to their calibration target to be visualized and detected. Since this framework estimates confidence limits and subsequently provides statistical significance tests, the approach is also very well suited for proxy screening prior to the generation of a climate-reconstruction network. Two examples of tree growth/climate relationships are provided, one from the North American Arctic treeline and the other from the upper treeline in the European Alps. Instabilities were found to be present where stabilities were reported in the literature, and vice versa, stabilities were found where instabilities were reported. We advise to apply SRFs in future proxy-screening schemes, next to the use of correlations and RE/CE statistics. It will improve the strength of reconstruction hindcasts.},

In addition, northern red oak (Q rubra L) was compared with the 2 indigenous oaks. The effects of controlled soil water deficits on growth and water relations of young plants of these 3 species grown in large boxes have been studied. The plants were old enough to have developed normal root systems. Two species were planted in each box, and submitted to very similar patterns of water stress. Predawn leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, net assimilation rates, shoot elongation and mortality were monitored. The effect of an overall improvement in mineral nutrition on these parameters was also tested. During water deficit (decrease in predawn leaf water potential), the pattern of decrease of gas exchange was similar for the 3 species. Thus, their ability to limit water deficit by reduction of transpiration was similar. On the other hand, shoot growth of Q rubra was more reduced than that of Q robur for similar predawn leaf water potential; growth of Q petraea was the least sensitive. However, increase of mineral nutrition improved the growth of both Q robur and Q rubra, but not that of Q petraea. For the 3 species, no mortality was noted as long as predawn leaf water potentials remained > -3.6 MPa. Below this limit, the mortality rate was highest in Q robur, Q petraea and lowest in Q rubra. These differences in mortality between species are due to differences in tolerance to water stress, not in avoidance.},

We analyzed the impacts of the drought on the hydrology and stemwood growth of a 33-year-old white pine plantation. Increment cores and dendrometer bands indicated a significant reduction in basal area growth during the drought for all tree classes (dominant, codominant, and intermediate) and shifts in patterns of seasonal growth. There was little variation in pine foliage litterfall over the drought period, but substantial variation in other litter-fall components (e.g. wood, cones, seeds, etc.). Precipitation-runoff (P-RO) relationships indicated less variation in evapotranspiration (ET) over the drought period than predicted by simulation modeling. The discrepancy between measured and modeled ET may be related to the importance of stored soil water to streamflow which dampens P-RO ET estimates. Regression analyses showed that growing season water potential explained as much as 61% of the variation in annual basal area growth. No significant relationships were established with climatic variables alone.},

  abstract = {Height:diameter ratios are an important measure of stand stability. Because of the importance of height:diameter ratios for forest management, individual-tree growth models should correctly depict height:diameter ratios. In particular, (i) height:diameter ratios should not exceed that of very dense stands, (ii) height:diameter ratios should not fall below that of open-grown trees, (iii) height:diameter ratios should decrease with increasing spacing, (iv) height:diameter ratios for suppressed trees should be higher than ratios for dominant trees. We evaluated the prediction of height:diameter ratios by running four commonly used individual-tree growth models in central Europe: BWIN, Moses, Silva and Prognaus. They represent different subtypes of individual-tree growth models, namely models with and without an explicit growth potential and models that are either distance-dependent (spatial) or distance-independent (non-spatial). Note that none of these simulators predict height:diameter ratios directly. We began by building a generic simulator that contained the relevant equations for diameter increment, height increment, and crown size for each of the four simulators. The relevant measures of competition, site characteristics, and stand statistics were also coded. The advantage of this simulator was that it ensured that no additional constraint was being imposed on the growth equations, and that initial conditions were identical. We then simulated growth for a 15- and 30-year period for Austrian permanent research plots in Arnoldstein and in Litschau, which represent stands at different age-classes and densities. We also simulated growth of open-grown trees and compared the results to the literature. We found that the general pattern of height:diameter ratios was correctly predicted by all four individual-tree growth models, with height:diameter ratios above that of open-grown trees and below that of very dense stands. All models showed a decrease of height:diameter ratios with age and an increase with stand density. Also, the height:diameter ratios of dominant trees were always lower than that of mean trees. Although in some cases the observed and predicted height:diameter ratios matched well, there were cases where discrepancies between observed and predicted height:diameter ratios would be unacceptable for practical management predictions.},

The results of the various studies are in close agreement and show that above-ground accumulation of carbon in forests is generally within the range 15-40 kg C/kg N. For heathlands, a range of 5-15 kg C/kg N has been observed based on low-dose N fertilizer experiments. The uncertainty in C sequestration per kg N addition in soils is larger than for above-ground biomass and varies on average between 5 and 35 kg C/kg N for both forests and heathlands. All together these data indicate a total carbon sequestration range of 5-75 kg C/kg N deposition for forest and heathlands, with a most common range of 20-40 kg C/kg N. Results cannot be extrapolated to systems with very high N inputs, nor to other ecosystems, such as peatlands, where the impact of N is much more variable, and may range from C sequestration to C losses.

As heat increased, stem density decreased while diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, total basal area, stand volume and biomass increased. Local site condition also had an important effect on forest structure. DBH–height relationship was significantly modulated by climate.

  abstract = {Data from the permanent plots in natural regrowth forests of mountain ash ( Eucalyptus regnans) and alpine ash ( E. delegatensis) in Victoria, Australia were used to evaluate the accuracy of projection by the growth model, STANDSIM. In general, where the stand ages used to initiate STANDSIM's projection were 15 years or more, the errors (biases) for one-year projections would be expected to be within 1% of the observed values for the projected future stand densities, 0.5% of the observed values for the projected stand basal areas, and within 1% of the observed values for the projected total product volumes. These resultant error estimates indicated that the accuracy of the future yields projected from STANDSIM model was generally in an acceptable range, if the projection intervals were less than 50 years and projections were initiated at a stand age of 15 years or older. However, the projected yields from this model would have a lower precision if the projections were initiated at stand ages of less than 15 years. As indicated by a previous researcher, the small-diameter trees were under-represented in the projected diameter distributions. This problem may indicate that the STANDSIM model overestimates the competition-induced mortality of natural ash eucalypt forests. However, our investigation did not indicate that this would result in a direct underestimation of pulpwood and overestimation of sawlog yield.},

The model can be used to project the stand attributes sampled in Victoria's Statewide Forest Resource Inventory (SFRI) for sustainable yield forecasts. Because a generalised stand table projection approach was adopted, a wide range of stand structures can be projected including both even-aged, unimodal diameter distribution stands and uneven-aged, multi-modal diameter distribution stands. Validation using repeat measurements from permanent plots indicates that for projection intervals less than 20 y, mean bias of projected yields was generally within±8% for stocking per hectare and ±0.5% for basal area per hectare for the two species. Projected future stand tables were evaluated against observed stand tables using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The null hypothesis that the predicted and observed diameter distributions arise from the same distribution could not be rejected for more than 84% of cases tested. It was concluded that the model is reliable for projecting SFRI data into future.},

  abstract = {Aims Changing climate and land use patterns make it increasingly important that the hydrology of catchments and ecosystems can be reliably characterized. The aim of this paper is to identify the biophysical factors that determine the rates of water vapor loss from different types of vegetation, and to seek, from an array of currently available satellite-borne sensors, those that might be used to initialize and drive landscape-level hydrologic models.Important Findings Spatial variation in the mean heights, crowd widths, and leaf area indices (LAI) of plant communities are important structural variables that affect the hydrology of landscapes. Canopy stomatal conductance (G) imposes physiological limitation on transpiration by vegetation. The maximum value of G (Gmax) is closely linked to canopy photosynthetic capacity, which can be estimated via remote sensing of foliar chlorophyll or nitrogen contents. G can be modeled as a nonlinear multipliable function of: (i) leaf–air vapor pressure deficit, (ii) water potential gradient between soil and leaves, (iii) photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, (iv) plant nutrition, (v) temperature and (vi) the CO2 concentration of the air. Periodic surveys with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and interferometric RADAR, along with high-resolution spectral coverage in the visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared bands, provide, along with meteorological data gathered from weather satellites, the kind of information required to model seasonal and interannual variation in transpiration and evaporation from landscapes with diverse and dynamic vegetation.},

  abstract = {Douglas-fir (Pseudotusga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), a native to the Pacific Coast Range in North America, is recognized as a tree that is long-lived and can grow rapidly to standing volumes that approach the highest recorded for temperate conifers. Managed plantations in western Oregon register maximum periodic annual increments (PAI) at ages between 20 and 40 years of ∼30 m3 ha−1 year−1. The same seed source, when planted in New Zealand and elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, may attain a PAI of ∼50 m3 ha−1 year−1. Is this higher productivity mainly related to climate or to isolation from native pests? To evaluate the role of climate, we obtained meteorological data from plantation sites in New Zealand and Oregon, from which we established relationships between mean monthly temperature extremes and solar irradiance, air humidity deficits, and frost frequency. Using these empirical relationships, long-term weather records were converted to the meteorological variables required to drive a process-based forest growth model, 3-PG, for sites approaching the most productive in New Zealand and in Oregon. Annual precipitation is similar in both areas, but sites in Oregon receive only 10% during the growing season, resulting in humidity deficits 30% larger than those recorded in New Zealand. According to sensitivity analyses and direct measurements, the more productive Douglas-fir forests in Oregon avoid the limiting effects of summer drought by obtaining water from the subsoil and fractured bedrock. If such forests were under a reduced evaporative demand similar to that in New Zealand, we show that they would exhibit comparable productivity.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need to understand what makes vegetation at some locations more sensitive to climate change than others. For savanna rangelands, this requires building knowledge of how forage production in different land types will respond to climate change, and identifying how location-specific land type characteristics, climate and land management control the magnitude and direction of its responses to change. Here, a simulation analysis is used to explore how forage production in 14 land types of the north-eastern Australian rangelands responds to three climate change scenarios of +3A degrees C, +17% rainfall; +2A degrees C, -7% rainfall; and +3A degrees C, -46% rainfall. Our results demonstrate that the controls on forage production responses are complex, with functional characteristics of land types interacting to determine the magnitude and direction of change. Forage production may increase by up to 60% or decrease by up to 90% in response to the extreme scenarios of change. The magnitude of these responses is dependent on whether forage production is water or nitrogen (N) limited, and how climate changes influence these limiting conditions. Forage production responds most to changes in temperature and moisture availability in land types that are water-limited, and shows the least amount of change when growth is restricted by N availability. The fertilisation effects of doubled atmospheric CO2 were found to offset declines in forage production under 2A degrees C warming and a 7% reduction in rainfall. However, rising tree densities and declining land condition are shown to reduce potential opportunities from increases in forage production and raise the sensitivity of pastures to climate-induced water stress. Knowledge of these interactions can be applied in engaging with stakeholders to identify adaptation options.},

  abstract = {Allocation is one of the central concepts in modern ecology, providing the basis for different strategies. Allocation in plants has been conceptualized as a proportional or ratio-driven process (‘partitioning’). In this view, a plant has a given amount of resources at any point in time and it allocates these resources to different structures. But many plant ecological processes are better understood in terms of growth and size than in terms of time. In an allometric perspective, allocation is seen as a size-dependent process: allometry is the quantitative relationship between growth and allocation. Therefore most questions of allocation should be posed allometrically, not as ratios or proportions. Plants evolve allometric patterns in response to numerous selection pressures and constraints, and these patterns explain many behaviours of plant populations. In the allometric view, plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant's allometric trajectory in response to the environment. Some allocation patterns show relatively fixed allometric trajectories, varying in different environments primarily in the speed at which the trajectory is travelled, whereas other allocation patterns show great flexibility in their behaviour at a given size. Because plant growth is often indeterminate and its rate highly influenced by environmental conditions, ‘plasticity in size’ is not a meaningful concept. We need a new way to classify, describe and analyze plant allocation and plasticity because the concepts ‘trait’ and ‘plasticity’ are too broad. Three degrees of plasticity can be distinguished: (1) allometric growth (‘apparent plasticity’), (2) modular proliferation and local physiological adaptation, and (3) integrated plastic responses. Plasticity, which has evolved because it increases individual fitness, can be a disadvantage in plant production systems, where we want to optimize population, not individual, performance.},

  abstract = {Assessing forest productivity is important for developing effective management regimes and predicting future growth. Despite some important limitations, the most common means for quantifying forest stand-level potential productivity is site index (SI). Another measure of productivity is gross primary production (GPP). In this paper, SI is compared with GPP estimates obtained from 3-PG and NASA's MODIS satellite. Models were constructed that predict SI and both measures of GPP from climate variables. Results indicated that a nonparametric model with two climate-related predictor variables explained over 68% and 76% of the variation in SI and GPP, respectively. The relationship between GPP and SI was limited (R(2) of 36%-56%), while the relationship between GPP and climate (R(2) of 76%-91%) was stronger than the one between SI and climate (R(2) of 68%-78%). The developed SI model was used to predict SI under varying expected climate change scenarios. The predominant trend was an increase of 0-5 m in SI, with some sites experiencing reductions of up to 10 m. The developed model can predict SI across a broad geographic scale and into the future, which statistical growth models can use to represent the expected effects of climate change more effectively.},

  abstract = {Simulating the influence of intensive management and annual weather fluctuations on tree growth requires a shorter time step than currently employed by most regional growth models. High-quality data sets are available for several plantation species in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, but the growth periods ranged from 2 to 12 years in length. Measurement periods of varying length complicate efforts to fit growth models because observed growth rates must be interpolated to a common length growth period or those growth periods longer or shorter than the desired model time step must be discarded. A variation of the iterative technique suggested by Cao [Cao, Q.V., 2000. Prediction of annual diameter growth and survival for individual trees from periodic measurements. Forest Sci. 46, 127-131] was applied to estimate annualized diameter and height growth equations for pure plantations of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and red alder. Using this technique, fits were significantly improved for all three species by embedding a multi-level nonlinear mixed-effects framework (likelihood ratio test: p < 0.0001). The final models were consistent with expected biological behavior of diameter and height growth over tree, stand, and site variables. The random effects showed some correlation with key physiographic variables such as slope and aspect for Douglas-fir and red alder, but these relationships were not observed for western hemlock. Further, the random effects were more correlated with physiographic variables than actual climate or soils information. Longterm simulations (12-16 years) on an independent dataset using these annualized equations showed that the multi-level mixed effects models were more accurate and precise than those fitted without random effects as mean square error (MSE) was reduced by 13 and 21% for diameter and height growth prediction, respectively. The level of prediction error was also smaller than an existing similar growth model with a longer time step (ORGANON v8) as the annualized equations reduced MSE by 17 and 38% for diameter and height growth prediction, respectively. These models will prove to be quite useful for understanding the interaction of weather and silviculture in the Pacific Northwest and refining the precision of future growth model projections.

  abstract = {The species self-thinning boundary line has been widely analyzed with a variety of statistical techniques. Most previous studies in the forestry literature have reported that the relationship does not differ across a range of stand and site factors, but these studies have primarily used statistical techniques that make model fitting subjective or interpretation of covariate significance difficult. There is growing evidence that the use of stochastic frontier analysis is an effective statistical means for objectively fitting the species self-thinning boundary line, offering the opportunity to test the influence of additional covariates. Using extensive even-aged coastal Douglas-fir (<I>Pseudotsuga menziesii</I> var. menziesii [Mirb.] Franco), western hemlock (<I>Tsuga heterophylla</I>), and red alder (<I>Alnus rubra</I> Bong.) data sets in the Pacific Northwest, we examined the assumption that the intercept and slope of the species self-thinning boundary line are insensitive to stand and site factors. Likelihood ratio tests indicated that site index, stand origin (natural versus planted), and purity (proportion of basal area in the primary species) significantly influenced the species self-thinning boundary line intercept for each of the species examined in this study. In Douglas-fir and western hemlock, the slope of the self-thinning boundary was also dependent on stand origin as well as site index in the case of Douglas-fir. Fertilization did not significantly influence the intercept or slope of the species self-thinning line for Douglas-fir and western hemlock. In addition, the inclusion of site aspect and dryness index marginally improved the red alder model of self-thinning, but neither site soil nor climatic variables improved the models for western hemlock and Douglas-fir.

  abstract = {Height growth equations for dominant trees are needed for growth and yield projections, to determine appropriate silvicultural regimes, and to estimate site index. Red alder [Alnus rubra Bong.] is a fast-growing hardwood species that is widely planted in the Pacific Northwest, USA. However, red alder dominant height growth equations used currently have been determined using stem analysis trees from natural stands rather than repeated measurements of stand-level top height from plantations, which may cause them to be biased. A regional dataset of red alder plantations was complied and used to construct a dynamic base-age invariant top height growth equation. Ten anamorphic and polymorphic Generalized Algebraic Difference Approach (GADA) forms were fit using the forward difference approach. The Chapman–Richards anamorphic and Schumacher anamorphic model forms were the only ones with statistically significant parameters that yielded biologically reasonable predictions across a full range of the available data. The Schumacher model form performed better on three independent datasets and, therefore, was selected as the final model. The resulting top height growth equations differed appreciably from tree-level dominant height growth equations developed using data from natural stands, particularly at the younger ages and on lower site indices. Both the rate and shape parameters of the Schumacher function were not influenced by initial planting density. However, this analysis indicates that the asymptote, which is related to site index, may be reduced for plantations with initial planting density below 500 trees ha−1. The final equation can be used for predictions of top height (and thus) site index for red alder plantations across a range of different growing conditions.},

The theory uses allometric scaling relations, based on metabolism and biomechanics, to quantify how trees use resources, fill space, and grow. These individual-level traits and properties scale up to predict emergent properties of forest stands, including size–frequency distributions, spacing relations, resource flux rates, and canopy configurations. Two insights emerge from this analysis: (i) The size structure and spatial arrangement of trees in the entire forest are emergent manifestations of the way that functionally invariant xylem elements are bundled together to conduct water and nutrients up from the trunks, through the branches, to the leaves of individual trees. (ii) Geometric and dynamic properties of trees in a forest and branches in trees scale identically, so that the entire forest can be described mathematically and behaves structurally and functionally like a scaled version of the branching networks in the largest tree. This quantitative framework uses a small number of parameters to predict numerous structural and dynamical properties of idealized forests.},

The rule is best understood with respect to a graph of log biomass (log B) per unit area vs. log density (log N) of survivors, known as the B–N diagram. The rule has three notable features—(1) mortality is a function only of biomass accumulation, (2) because mortality is driven by the rate of accumulation of biomass, mortality is slower when conditions for growth are worse, and (3) the thinning line has a slope of about –½ for most studied species under most conditions. Two main effects operate in developing distributions in even-aged stands. First, large plants suppress small plants. The result is a “hierarchy of dominance and suppression” in which the smaller plants are at an accumulating disadvantage and finally die. Second, the mortality of smaller individuals truncates the distribution from the left. },

We developed three tree-ring chronologies for climatic analyses from oak cores taken from the Jefferson National Forest, Virginia, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee. We statistically compared the three chronologies with monthly climatic data from 1930 to 2005. The results of our analyses suggest that oak species in the southern Appalachian Mountains require a cool, moist summer for above average-growth to occur. The climate signal increased in duration from high to low elevational and latitudinal gradients, indicating a strong moisture-preconditioning signal during the previous fall at our lowest elevation site. A notable finding of this research was the degree of responsiveness in oaks that are growing in forest interior locations where strong climate sensitivity would not be expected because of the effects of internal stand dynamics. Furthermore, the relationships between evapotranspiration rates and the geographic factors of elevation, latitude, and aspect influence the climate signals at the three sites. Our research suggests that oaks located in a warm and xeric climate experience more physiological stress and put forth a more varied climatic response.},

La relation entre la surface foliaire et le produit surface d'aubier × perméabilité était linéaire et les données des trois parcelles se groupaient sur la même droite. La surface d'aubier, la perméabilité et leur produit diminuaient avec la profondeur à travers la cime des arbres.

Because of intrinsic differences in the symmetry of competition for light and below-ground resources, it is hypothesized that the overall expression of competition varies as a consequence of variations in water availability. Historical growth and precipitation data from an unthinned stand of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) in Denmark are analysed with respect to the effects of precipitation on competition symmetry. The shape and linearity of the size-increment relationship are analysed, and the temporal development of diameter distribution and size hierarchy is modelled. The test value of lack of linear fit through the origin for the diameter/increment relationship plotted against precipitation in the growth period forms a triangular envelope. indicating a more curvilinear relationship for years with high water availability. This indicates that dominant trees apparently benefit more from increased precipitation than suppressed trees which is also shown in the analysis of the temporal development of the diameter distribution-and as a consequence the size hierarchy increases. Finally. it is proposed that temporal and spatial variations in the availability of water and other below-ground resources may have similar effects on competition symmetry.

At the end of the 10-week, outdoor pot experiment, clonal differences were observed in: (1) water-use efficiency of aboveground biomass production (WUE); (2) resistance to xylem cavitation; and (3) stomatal conductance to leaf-specific, whole-plant hydraulic conductance ratio (gst/KP; an indicator of water balance). Across clones and regimes, WUE was positively correlated with the assimilation rate to stomatal conductance ratio (A/gst), a measure of instantaneous water-use efficiency. Both of these water-use efficiency indicators were generally higher in drought-treated trees compared with well-watered trees. However, the between-treatment differences in (shoot-based) WUE were smaller than expected, considering the differences in A/gst for two of the clones, possibly because plants reallocated dry mass from shoots to roots when subject to drought. Higher root hydraulic conductance to shoot hydraulic conductance ratios (KR/KS) during drought supports this hypothesis. The same clones were also the most sensitive to xylem cavitation and, accordingly, showed the strongest reduction in gst/KP in response to drought. Drought acclimation was manifested in decreased gst, gst/KP, osmotic potential and leaf area to vessel internal cross-sectional area ratio, and increased KR, KP and WUE. Increased resistance to stem xylem cavitation in response to drought was observed in only one clone. It is concluded that WUE and drought resistance traits are inter-linked and that both may be enhanced by selection and breeding.},

  abstract = {Tree rings have been used to both reconstruct past climate, and to estimate and project carbon uptake of forest ecosystems. Here we show that large groups of trees of the dominant tree species within widely-distributed circumpolar forest sites show opposing growth trends during recent warming. These opposing growth trends are present at a sub-chronology level and, if averaged into chronologies, may have contributed to the widely reported overall decreased temperature sensitivity of high-latitude chronologies over recent decades. Unlike previous studies, we find that temperature sensitivity has actually increased for most individual trees at these sites. This recent, widespread divergence in growth response seems unique over the past three centuries, and may relate to different microsite responses of individual trees to temperature-induced drought stress or other factors. This divergence needs to be taken into account in dendroclimatic reconstructions, estimations of global warming impacts, and carbon uptake projections.},

  abstract = {Dendroclimatological research is often based on the assumption that the relationship between tree growth and climate is not variable over time. Here we test this assumption by exploring if climate sensitivity of Picea mariana (Mill.) trees growing in open-stand lowland forest and on top of a neighboring peatland in Interior Alaska is stable or changing over time. Climate-growth correlations at the study sites are strongly dependent on microtopography and vary substantially over time. Trees growing in the open forest site generally display stronger climate-growth correlations, especially significantly negative correlations with late summer temperatures (July, August) starting in the period 1920-1970. Trees growing on the peatland site are less climate sensitive, but display positive correlations between annual growth and temperature of October and December in the early 20th century, while in the late 20th century, significant negative correlations exist with January and February temperatures. This study, thus, demonstrates a transient climate-growth response for P. mariana (Mill.) on two sites typical for lowland Interior Alaska. However, due to multiple possible explanations (e.g. changing climate, coupled with aging trees and a growing peatland surface) it is not possible at this time to pinpoint the exact cause for these changes in the climate-growth relationships.

  abstract = {No current tree ring (TR) based reconstruction of extratropical Northern Hemisphere (ENH) temperatures that extends into the 1990s captures the full range of late 20th century warming observed in the instrumental record. Over recent decades, a divergence between cooler reconstructed and warmer instrumental large-scale temperatures is observed. We hypothesize that this problem is partly related to the fact that some of the constituent chronologies used for previous reconstructions show divergence against local temperatures in the recent period. In this study, we compiled TR data and published local/regional reconstructions that show no divergence against local temperatures. These data have not been included in other large-scale temperature reconstructions. Utilizing this data set, we developed a new, completely independent reconstruction of ENH annual temperatures (1750-2000). This record is not meant to replace existing reconstructions but allows some degree of independent validation of these earlier studies as well as demonstrating that TR data can better model recent warming at large scales when careful selection of constituent chronologies is made at the local scale. Although the new series tracks the increase in ENH annual temperatures over the last few decades better than any existing reconstruction, it still slightly under predicts values in the post-1988 period. We finally discuss possible reasons why it is so difficult to model post-mid-1980s warming, provide some possible alternative approaches with regards to the instrumental target and detail several recommendations that should be followed in future large-scale reconstruction attempts that may result in more robust temperature estimates.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the temporal stability of growth/climate relationships in ring-width chronologies of Norway spruce [ Picea abies (L.) Karst] and silver fir ( Abies alba Mill) in the Lower Bavarian Forest region in southern Germany. These chronologies were compiled, using both historic and living tree-ring data, with the main aim of developing a dendroclimatic reconstruction for the region covering the last 500 years. Moving window correlation analysis shows that prior to the twentieth century, both species co-vary in a similar way (1480-1899 mean r =0.66). There is no significant correlation between the species chronologies since ca. 1930, which partly reflects anomalous growth trends in the fir chronology since ca. 1960. Multiple regression analysis was utilised to assess the ability of both species chronologies to model March-August precipitation. The precipitation signal of the spruce data was found to be both stronger than the fir data (1872-1930 calibration: r(2)=0.45 vs 0.25) and more time stable. After ca. 1930, the fir chronology loses it ability to model March-August precipitation until there is no climate signal at all in the fir data in recent decades. The spruce data also express a later weakening in their climate signal in the mid 1970s. We present compelling evidence indicating that the anomalous trends observed in the fir data, since the mid 1960s, appear to be predominantly related to local SO2 emissions from power plants and refineries. It is also likely that this local anthropogenic forcing is the cause of the weakening of the climate signal in the spruce data since the mid 1970s. The conclusions from this study are: (1) The fir tree-ring data cannot be used for traditional dendroclimatic calibration, although prior to the twentieth century the decadal variability in the fir data is very similar to spruce and so these data could be used to extend potential reconstructions in the future; (2) The recent decline and recovery event in the fir data appears to be unique to the twentieth century and is not part of a natural episodic phenomenon; (3) Traditional dendroclimatic calibration of March-August precipitation will be made using solely the spruce ring-width data. However, due to SO2 forcing in recent decades, the calibration period will be shortened to the 1871-1978 period.},

Many discussions of simulation, and indeed the term "numerical experiments," invoke a strong metaphor of experimentation.

The aim of the paper is to try to reconcile these two points of view-to understand what methodological and epistemological features simulation has in common with experimentation, while at the same time keeping a keen eye on simulation's ancestry as a form of scientific theorizing. In so doing, it seeks to apply some of the insights of recent work on the philosophy of experiment to an aspect of theorizing that is of growing philosophical interest: the construction of local models.},

In the context of generalized linear mixed models, this paper exploits the link between random effects and penalized regression to develop a simple test for a zero effect. The idea is to treat the variance components not being tested as fixed at their estimates and then to express the likelihood ratio as a readily computed quadratic form in the predicted values of the random effects. Under the null hypothesis this has the distribution of a weighted sum of squares of independent standard normal random variables. The test can be used with generalized linear mixed models, including those estimated by penalized quasilikelihood.},

This distance-independent model is applicable over much of the northern Rockies, an extensive region where stands have considerable variation in species composition, age structure, and past management. The model represents the diverse ecological requirements of the various species and responds appropriately across the observed range of predictor variables. Furthermore, it is well behaved even when used for conditions found in the region but not represented in the large calibration data set (44,086 trees). In addition, it possesses desirable statistical properties such as homogeneous residual variance, minimal multicollinearity, and linear parameters. The model is validated against independent data from two sources: a research study of young managed stands (2,881 trees) and a collection of long-term permanent research plots (6,594 trees). Predictions for small suppressed trees from the permanent plots are generally too large, but there are no significant relationships between residuals and other predictor variables in either data set. An unusual feature of the model is the intentional omission of site index and age, which is motivated by the large number of irregular stands in the region. Validation tests using the permanent research plots indicate, however, that residuals are not correlated with site index and age. Furthermore, long-term projections of stand attributes are unbiased.

  abstract = {The difference between actual and predicted growth rates for the conifer regions of northern California has been observed to vary with climatic changes. This study presents a method to investigate the relationship between growth and climate. Growth variations attributable to biological and cultural factors were removed by using the CACTOS (California conifer timber output simulator) program. The remaining variation was then associated with relative precipitation and temperature for the projected period and the CACTOS calibration period. Climatic data from the current and preceding years were considered. Elevation, stand density, and species were also investigated to determine their effects on the format and magnitude of the relationship between growth and climate. The results of this study, which included tests of stem analysis data taken over 15 years, indicate that growth variation is associated with the climatic changes of winter precipitation and summer temperatures for the region, in addition to biological and cultural factors. Winter precipitation and summer temperatures affect growth in the current and the subsequent years. Moreover, the relationship between climate and growth changes by densities and species. This study provides a basis for using short-term growth data to make long-term growth projections with growth adjusted to long-term climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Wood production generally declines as forests age. The decrease in production has been attributed to higher respiration associated with increasing biomass, but direct measurements fail to support this assumption. An alternate hypothesis is that the growth decline is caused by reduced net photosynthesis. To test this hypothesis, we compared the net photosynthetic rates of foliage from trees that had ceased height growth with foliage from actively growing, mature trees. Results showed that net photosynthesis per unit area of 1-yr-old foliage from old Pinus contorta and P. ponderosa averaged 14-30% lower than the same-aged foliage from younger trees. Computer simulations from a previous study indicated that differences of this magnitude are sufficient to explain the lower wood production in old trees. The cause of the photosynthetic decline is not clear, but it did not appear to be due to a reduction in the maximum capacity for photosynthesis. Ratios of stable carbon isotopes from leaves and wood indicated a greater stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in older trees. A possible relationship between lower hydraulic conductance in the vascular systems of older trees leading to greater stomatal closure is discussed. For. Sci. 40(3):513-527.},

  abstract = {This review paper provides an overview of approaches to which we may resort for handling the complex decision problems involving uncertainty and risk that climate change implies for forest managers. Modelling approaches that could support adaptive management strategies seem to be called for, not only as climate change denotes increased economic uncertainty but also because new and more reliable information becomes available as time passes and climate changes. The paper (1) provides a broad overview of state-of-the-art methods for optimal decision making under risk and uncertainty in forestry and (2) elaborates on the possible use of these methods in adaptive forest management under climate change. A survey of the current literature is carried out to identify approaches and developments that may prove most promising in relation to different challenges to the adaptive management of forest ecosystems under climate change. Most studies focusing on changing, typically increasing, risks in forest management under climate change tend to build on existing approaches about changes in risk levels contingent on climate change scenarios. Finally, we discuss what to emphasise in future studies to improve the understanding of adaptive forest management and decision support tools needed to cope with climate change.},

  abstract = {Approaches to combining information generated from different models are recognized for improving forecast quality. However, such an approach has not been developed for forest growth predictions. Therefore, a study was carried out to investigate the potential of combining models to forecast forest growth. A growth prediction system was developed for Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) by combining growth information generated from tree- and stand-level growth models parameterized from an identical data source. The tree-level model predicts relative tree diameter growth rates of a cumulative diameter distribution. The stand-level models predict absolute stand basal area growth. The combined prediction system consists of three basic steps: preliminary prediction, combination, and feedback modification. Preliminary predictions of stand basal area growth are generated annually from both types of growth models. The preliminary predictions are then combined on the basis of a variance and covariance method, and the combined estimator is used to update the growth models in a feedback procedure. In the tree-level growth model, the updated stand basal area is subsequently disaggregated to individual trees. On the basis of a validation data set, forecasts of stand basal area with the combined prediction system were shown to gain in efficiency from 14 to 43% compared with forecasts with the tree-level model alone and from 4 to 16% compared with projections with the stand-level model, depending on the length of the projection (5-30 years).},

  abstract = {The predicted increase in frequency and intensity of climatic extremes, like drought episodes, imposes a challenge on the choice of commercial forest trees under climate change conditions. The present study aims at quantifying the impact of summer drought on growth of spruce, pine, silver fir, beech and oak as the main forest tree species in Southern Germany, and includes Douglas fir as a possible alternative for spruce. Series of tree-ring widths from more than 1400 trees from 48 sites all over Bavaria and adjacent states are employed for growth/climate modeling and pointer year analysis to derive predications about the climatic limitation of tree growth subject to species, regional climate and site quality. Response functions relating tree growth to climatic variables in monthly resolution have been applied. The obtained parameters were subject to principal component analysis to derive a more condensed representation of climatic constraints on tree growth. Soil water balance modeling was applied to refine the connections between regional climate and growth reactions to drought in terms of site quality. A modification of Brook90 (Brook90-LWF) has been employed for water balance modeling. Pointer years were choosen a priori according to documented drought years and used to calculate short- and long-term impact of drought on tree-growth. For all species under investigation, critical areas for tree growth could be identified. Generally, the warmer and drier northern part of the investigation area is more unfavorable, with spruce generally being more affected than other species in terms of short- and long-term impact of summer drought on tree-growth (Figure 1). Furthermore, in a condensed view of dendroclimatic forcings, spruce depicts the strongest connection to the aspect "summer drought" throughout the investigation area, whereas oak shows the weakest connection (Figure 5). As a main result, oak is superior to all other species under investigation regarding drought tolerance throughout the investigation area. But also silver fir could replace the most critical spruce on a wide range of sites. Furthermore, the surprisingly high variability in reaction to drought observed on regional and stand level (Figure 3) implies a high adaptive potential of the populations within the possibilities of their inherent genetic diversity, hampering the derivation of clear climatic or site-related thresholds (compare Figure 2).},

  abstract = {Growth of plants results from two opposing factors: the intrinsic tendency toward unlimited increase (biotic potential) and restraints imposed by environmental resistance and aging. The expansion tendency prevails in the beginning of a tree's life, while growth decline becomes prominent toward the end. The existing growth equations can be transformed (by differentiation, decomposition into the division components, and taking logarithms) so that the components that correspond to these two factors are exposed. This transformation reveals two basic forms intrinsic in most of the analyzed equations. Their common feature is that growth expansion is proportional to current tree size. Growth decline of individual trees appears to be more variable and can be rendered with equal accuracy by a variety of expressions. This may reflect that a greater number of factors hinder growth: scarcity of resources, competition, reproduction, diseases, herbivory, disturbances, etc. Consequently, the growth path is inherently imprecise and can be viewed as a wide valley rather than a single line. This analysis laid groundwork for the classification of known equations and made possible the discovery of a promising new equation form.},

  abstract = {The search for a stand density that maximizes total volume growth has continued since the beginning of forestry without producing a definite answer. One of the reasons is that the effect of density on growth is not always separated from those of tree size and age. Such a separation is not easy when the relationship between density and growth is expressed as a graph (Langsaeter's curve). This study develops a simple model that accounts for each main growth predictor individually. It allows one to calculate the density that maximizes volume growth at any given moment (current annual increment of volume). Just as the maximum Reineke's index, this density optimum does not change with age. Fitting the model to long-term data confirms the obvious: because a complete crown closure intercepts more light than a broken canopy, the densest stands produce maximum volume growth. Thus, the current optimal density is equal to maximum density. What is less obvious is that maximum current stand volume growth does not sum up to maximum stand volume. In addition to density, stand volume depends on average tree size, which is larger in less dense stands. The high current density that maximizes volume growth also minimizes diameter increment, which eventually reduces average diameter and stand volume. When density is kept at a stationary (over time) level by thinning, maximum volume is produced by stands with substantially lower density than the current optimum. even higher volume can probably be obtained when density changes with age. The challenge is to find this optimum path of density.},

A model accounting for both factors allows us to quantify stand density and find a single number characterizing the density of undisturbed stands. The number changes with species, being higher for more shade tolerant ones. It is found that the second factor affects survival of trees but not their growth. This means that there are two kinds of stand density.},

  abstract = {Forestry is a large field with a long history and extensive contents consisting of practical recommendations arrived at by trial and error. In contrast, the science of forestry is a new development relying on reasoning to produce the optimal system of forest management aimed at satisfying human needs and preserving nature at the same time (though not at the same place). The presented overview of this science consists of two parts. The first one develops a theory of tree growth and stand dynamics. The second part applies this theory to optimize forest management and suggest practical recommendations. What unites these two parts is a general method of inquiry. It starts with defining one problem, designs two opposing explanations, and then fuses them into a single solution. Hence, the name: the 1-2-1 method. Unlike material variables of process-based models, the explanations employed by the method are abstractions that outline the boundaries embracing all possible solutions. Each explanation in its turn may be subdivided into two opposites until a solution is reached by bringing the opposites together. The 1-2-1 method accounts for any number of variables by arranging them hier- archically into paired groups. Why exactly two explanations? Because each complex problem has two opposite sides, waiting to be uncovered. We may never know how many factors determine tree growth, yet there is one thing as certain as any mathematical proposition: All these factors are of two kinds - those that facilitate growth and those that restrain it. A factor that does neither is not really a factor. The basic positive process of tree growth is uninhibited cell division. Negative processes include, among others, aging and impediments associated with increasing tree size. When these and several other processes are expressed analytically, we get a meaningful and accurate model of tree growth comprising three pairs of opposites arranged in two levels. The model generalizes empirical equations developed in forestry and exposes biological mechanisms that justify the structure of the equations and explain their success. The resulting growth model describes density-independent growth. The complementary process of competition has inter- and intraspecific components. It is shown that to maximize forest productivity interspecific competition has to be minimized while the intraspecific kind optimized. Uniting the growth model with that describing the effect of intraspecific competition produces the growth-density model that solves many questions of forest management. In particular, the model helps to reconcile two main goals of management: (a) maximizing the financial returns from wood products, and (b) preserving forests with all their biodiversity and invaluable ecosystem services. Still, the thrust of this review is not another growth model or management system. The main point is an attempt to make forestry a science by consistent reasoning from first principles such as discreteness of plant biomass, the inverse relationship between average size and number of trees, and the conflict between the biotic potential and environmental resistance.},

  abstract = {Self-thinning of forest stands is one of the clearest and best-documented examples of natural selection. Besides their theoretical interest, understanding of self-thinning is important for forest practice because it produces estimates of stand density and stocking. There is a considerable diversity of views on the processes causing self-thinning, predicting variables, and analytical form of models. The most popular model was proposed by Reineke (J Agric Res 46(7):627-638, 1933) over 70 years ago. This study compares existing models of self-thinning and provides evidence that the virtually unknown model developed by Artur Nilson describes self-thinning more realistically than Reineke's. While in the Reineke model the rate of mortality (the slope of self-thinning line) is assumed to be constant, it changes from 0 to -2 in Nilson's model. As a result, Nilson's model is slightly but consistently more accurate than Reineke's. Although both models are empirical, their analysis suggests several general conclusions about self-thinning.},

Tree mortality has been observed to increase over the past decades in many regions, but the causes of this increase are not well understood, and we know even less about long-term changes in growth and recruitment rates. Using a dataset of long-term (1958–2009) observations on 1,680 permanent sample plots from undisturbed natural forests in western Canada, we found that tree demographic rates have changed markedly over the last five decades. We observed a widespread, significant increase in tree mortality, a significant decrease in tree growth, and a similar but weaker trend of decreasing recruitment. However, these changes varied widely across tree size, forest age, ecozones, and species. We found that competition was the primary factor causing the long-term changes in tree mortality, growth, and recruitment. Regional climate had a weaker yet still significant effect on tree mortality, but little effect on tree growth and recruitment. This finding suggests that internal community-level processes—more so than external climatic factors—are driving forest dynamics.},

Forecast combination method combines information from different models, disperses errors generated from different models, and then improves forecast accuracy. And then the forecast combination model was linked to diameter-distribution models via parameter recovery methods. During the moment estimation, two methods were used, arithmetic mean diameter and quadratic mean diameter method (A-Q method), and arithmetic mean diameter and diameter variance method (A-V method). Results showed that the forecast combination for predicting stand variables outperformed over the stand-level and tree-level models respectively; A-V method was superior to A-Q method on estimating Weibull parameters; these three different models could be linked very well via forecast combination and parameter recovery.},

  abstract = {Divergent responses between tree growth and climate factors have been widely reported at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Here we show variable climate-growth relationships and divergent growth responses of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassfolia) along an elevation gradient at a mid-latitude site at the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, China. Trees from higher elevations, limited mainly by temperature, show divergent growth trends over time and two responses to climate. Some trees show increasing positive and some increasing negative responses to growing season temperature during the last decades. Trees from lower treeline show a strengthening drought stress signal over time and no divergent growth trends within sites. Our results indicate that single tree analysis might be a worthwhile tool to (1) uncover spatial-temporal changes in climate-growth relationships of trees, (2) better understand future growth performance and (3) help overcome current limitations of tree ring based climatic reconstructions.

Parameters of the self-thinning lines are often confounded by differences across various stand and site conditions. For overcoming the problem of hierarchical and repeated measures, we used hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate the self-thinning line. The results showed that the self-thinning line for Chinese fir (<italic>Cunninghamia lanceolata</italic> (Lamb.)Hook.) plantations was not sensitive to the initial planting density. The uncertainty of model predictions was mostly due to within-subject variability. The simulation precision of hierarchical Bayesian method was better than that of stochastic frontier function (SFF). Hierarchical Bayesian method provided a reasonable explanation of the impact of other variables (site quality, soil type, aspect, etc.) on self-thinning line, which gave us the posterior distribution of parameters of self-thinning line. The research of self-thinning relationship could be benefit from the use of hierarchical Bayesian method.</p>},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of cambial age, clone and climatic factors (i.e. monthly mean temperature and monthly total precipitation) on ring width (RW) and ring density (RD) development from pith to bark in 30-years-old Norway spruce ( Picea abies) grown on a fertile agricultural soil in southeastern Finland. The material consisted of 20 Finnish clones, which represented south, southwest, southeast and central Finnish origins. We analysed the variability of RW and RD among years, individual trees and clones, by fitting mixed models into tree ring series, with a spline function (used to remove the effect of ring age). The results showed that cambial age, clone and mean temperature of July affected both RW and RD. Furthermore, total precipitation of August affected RW and total precipitation of May affected RD. However, these climate variables explained only 1.9% and 3.4% of the total RW and RD variability, respectively. This may be due to the good site fertility with no lack of soil water availability, but also due to relatively short tree ring series available for data analyses. The effect of mean temperature of July on RW varied among clones, but in general, RW increased with increase in temperature. The increase of total precipitation of August increased, in general, RD regardless of the clone, whereas the effect of mean July temperature on RD was much more variable. However, longer time series are needed in the future to provide a better understanding of the interactive effects of the climate variables and genetic origins, in addition to cambial age, on RW and RD development on different sites.},

If a randomsample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
